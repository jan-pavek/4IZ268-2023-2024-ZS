        An image of Rogan filled the screen. He sat at a desk that seemed too small for his huge frame, illuminated by
        the light streaming through a large bay window. Behind him a breathtaking vista spread, a mountain thrusting
        into the sapphire-blue Mediterranean, with white homes perched on its side. Taken several months ago during
        their trip to Spain.<br>
        “Connor?” my sister asked off-screen.<br>
        “Mhm?” My brother-in-law stared at his laptop, looking down, his short dark hair disheveled slightly, his strong
        profile silhouetted against the glass.<br>
        “You know how I’ve been throwing up?”<br>
        “Did you see the doctor?” he asked.<br>
        “Yes.”<br>
        Rogan’s fingers flew over the keyboard. “What did he say.<br>
        “I know why I’ve been sick.”<br>
        “Is it a stomach bug?”<br>
        “Not exactly.”<br>
        He turned to look at her, his eyes startlingly blue on his tan face. “Is it serious?”<br>
        “Yes. Apparently, I’ve already had it for eight weeks. I just didn’t notice. But she says it will go away on its
        own in seven months.”<br>
        He stood up, frowning. “What kind of illness lasts for nine months…”<br>
        “Good question.”<br>
        Connor “Mad” Rogan froze, his blue eyes opened wide. The window behind him shattered. It didn’t fracture into
        shards or chunks, it disintegrated into glass dust and hung in place, a glittering diamond cloud full of
        shimmering rainbows. He’d pulverized it.<br>
        It was such a stunning image, a shocked Mad Rogan against the curtain of glass sparkling with sunlight.<br>
        Nevada yanked the tablet away.<br>
        “There is more! Let me see!”<br>
        “No!” she smacked my hand. “The rest is private.”<br>
        I laughed at her.<br>
        She tucked the tablet under her arm.

    <p>Michael Latimer was a very large man.</p>
    <p>It was an unfair description. There were other things one noted about him, things that were more concerning and
        carried greater weight. The way he sat, elegant, poised, relaxed, but conveying a coiled readiness. The way he
        held himself, with utter confidence. The razor-sharp intellect shining in his dark eyes. But the size was the
        first thing that made an impression.</p>
    <p>He was six feet and five inches tall. His build matched his height, and the perfectly tailored suit in
        Argentinian blue expertly accentuated his wide shoulders, broad chest, and narrow waist. He wore a crisp navy
        shirt under it and the color combination flattered his dark brown skin. His curly black hair was cut short, and
        a stylish goatee beard and mustache defined his ridiculously square jaw. Our main conference room was large, and
        he had taken up most of it with his presence.</p>
    <p>I was alone, sitting across the table. Just me and my tablet. The fewer people were involved, the better.</p>
    <p>This was a long time coming.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“I’ll make it simple, Prime Baylor.” His voice was deep and measured. You knew that if this man screamed, the
        world was probably ending. “I know you have my cousin.”</p>
    <p>
        Not “my cousin is here,” or “my cousin is your guest,” but you <em>have</em>
        my cousin, meaning his cousin was in my possession, and he was determined to break my hold on her at all costs.
    </p>
    <p>“You will produce Regina. I will speak to her. And then, we will leave.”</p>
    <p>I didn’t say anything.</p>
    <p>“What are we waiting for?” he asked.</p>
    <p>“It takes a while to walk from the workshop to the office,” I told him.</p>
    <p>Michael gave me a sharp look.</p>
    <p>I was beginning to think that Michaels were my Audrey.&nbsp;For various reasons, our family had problems with
        women named Audrey, and now Michaels were proving to be equally difficult. The Keeper’s Michael summoned death
        in the form of living darkness. Michael Latimer built constructs held together by magic and animated with his
        will.&nbsp;They were lethal and indestructible, and on a scale of dangerous Primes one shouldn’t let into her
        office, he was at the very top of the list.</p>
    <p>A quiet clicking of metal on stone came through the open door. Cinder sauntered into the room, a slick black
        feline the size of a bull terrier made of steel and plastic. She sat by the door, curled her tail around her
        paws, and stared at us with glowing emerald eyes of pure magic.</p>
    <p>Regina followed her cat. Her hair was loose today, and it floated around her head in a curly halo. Her skin tone
        matched Michael’s, the same rich brown with a golden undertone. She wore a wraparound blue sundress with tiny
        flowers on it and strappy sandals.</p>
    <p>They had coincidentally chosen the exact same shade of blue.</p>
    <p>Regina opened her arms, the glass bracelets on her wrist twinkling.&nbsp;Michael stood up, and she hugged him.
    </p>
    <p>“You look well, Prime Latimer,” she told him.</p>
    <p>“Are you alright?” he asked. “Are you being held here?”</p>
    <p>She pointed to his chair. “Sit down.&nbsp;Let’s talk.”</p>
    <p>He sat. She waved her fingers. Cinder shut the door with her paw and coiled in front of it. Regina took a chair.
    </p>
    <p>Michael looked at me. “You can go now.”</p>
    <p>Ha!</p>
    <p>“She stays,” Regina said.</p>
    <p>“Why?”</p>
    <p>“Because it’s her office, Michael. And I want her to know the whole story.&nbsp;My wife and I didn’t tell her
        much, except that my family would become a problem, and she said that we’d deal with it when it
        happened.&nbsp;This is us dealing.”</p>
    <p>Michael raised his hands. “Okay. Whatever you want.”</p>
    <p>They sat.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“Three years, Regina.&nbsp;Not a word. No email, no texts.&nbsp;Not a single phone call. Your mother won’t talk
        to me.&nbsp;Your father cries every time your name is mentioned.” He leaned forward. “Why?&nbsp;What went
        wrong?&nbsp;How can we fix it?”</p>
    <p>Regina turned to me. “This is a long story. Our fathers were brothers. My father, Ray Latimer, is the oldest, and
        Michael’s father, Reggie, was two years younger. They looked exactly the same. When they were little, people
        would ask my grandma if they were twins.”</p>
    <p>Michael settled back into his chair. He clearly didn’t like discussing their family in front of me, but he
        must’ve decided that keeping Regina talking was more important.</p>
    <p>“My father, I’m going to call him Ray from now on, Ray grew up thinking he would be the head of our family. We
        didn’t have any Primes in the bloodline, but each generation was a little stronger than the last, so our vector
        was pointing up. My grandfather made sure that both Ray and Reggie understood that Latimer name had to stand for
        something in Dallas and that one day our family would become a House.”</p>
    <p>That wasn’t unusual.&nbsp;A lot of people took pride in their family name, and most bloodlines that consistently
        produced Significants hoped to become a House.</p>
    <p>“Ray was healthy. Michael’s father had asthma. Uncle Reggie was big and strong, but he couldn’t run around and
        play like the other kids. Ray took care of Reggie. He wouldn’t let anyone bully him because nobody picked on Ray
        Latimer’s brother.”</p>
    <p>“It wasn’t exactly like that,” Michael said.</p>
    <p>“It was exactly like that,” she said. “Their roles were all set. Ray would run the family and get the lion’s
        share of the glory, and Reggie would be his helpful sidekick. Except Serenity Hamilton came along.&nbsp;She was
        a Prime from a small but gifted Animator House and her parents wanted to find her a husband who would join their
        family. Ray was in the running, but Reggie got the girl.”</p>
    <p>“Ray didn’t like it?” I guessed.</p>
    <p>Regina smiled. “Ray was livid. In his head, Reggie had stolen what should have been his. His younger, weaker
        brother, the burden he carried so nobly, had upstaged him. Serenity loved Reggie so much, that she even went
        against her parents’ wishes to marry him. She took his name and became a Latimer.&nbsp;None of aligned with the
        Hamiltons’ plans. Nobody was happy, except for Reggie and Serenity.&nbsp;They moved to Houston and then they had
        Michael.”</p>
    <p>Michael rolled his eyes.</p>
    <p>“He was the cutest baby ever.”</p>
    <p>“I’m older than you,” the former cutest baby boomed. “You don’t remember.”</p>
    <p>“I’ve seen pictures. The baby made the Hamiltons rethink things, and then Michael’s powers manifested. He is
        brilliant. Off the charts brilliant. Do you know that he animated his first functional construct when he was two
        years old?”</p>
    <p>I looked at Michael.&nbsp;“Is that good?”</p>
    <p>“Most of us begin building when we’re toddlers,” he said. “We try to animate bits and pieces.&nbsp;It’s a
        compulsion.&nbsp;We have to do it, but most people don’t put the whole process together into a functional
        construct until they are five or six. I just started early.”</p>
    <p>“He is very modest.”&nbsp;Regina reached out and patted Michael’s arm. “The Hamiltons were so impressed, they
        dissolved their House and reformed under Latimer so he could have the protection he needed to grow. It nearly
        ended Ray. That should have been his beautiful wife, that should have been his talented son, and that should
        have been his House. He couldn’t deal with it. The man is full of bitter hatred. He runs on it like a car on
        gasoline.”</p>
    <p>“He got over it,” Michael said.</p>
    <p>Regina shook her head. “Not even close. Ray became preoccupied with getting his own House just like Reggie’s. He
        wasn’t a Prime, so making powerful kids had to be the answer. &nbsp;He just had to prove that his baby batter
        was even better than his brother’s.”</p>
    <p>Baby batter…</p>
    <p>Michael grimaced.&nbsp;“I wish you hadn’t said that.”</p>
    <p>She winked at me and kept going. “Ray married my mother, another upper range Significant, and they had three
        children, and then Ray stepped out on Mama to have two more on the side. None of us panned out. Oh, we’re all
        strong, and smart, and talented, but that doesn’t matter. He kept trying for a Prime and we failed him.”</p>
    <p>“Look, what is all of this about?” Michael asked.</p>
    <p>“I’m getting there. My dad wanted nothing to do with his brother or his niece and nephew, but then Reggie died.
        His wife was attacked, and he sacrificed himself to protect her and the kids. Michael was thirteen. One of those
        fun House stories we all keep in our drawer.”</p>
    <p>“I’m sorry,” I told Michael. It wasn’t a surprise, since I had done the full background check on him when we
        first considered hiring Patricia but knowing about it didn’t make it resonate any less. “My father died as
        well.”</p>
    <p>“I know,” Michael said.</p>
    <p>“Anyway, Ray saw his chance,” Regina said. “I remember it like it was yesterday.&nbsp;We had a grand family
        reunion. Ray rented the Dallas Oasis, this huge ten-acre estate with manicured lawns and waterfalls. I remember
        white tablecloths and pastel roses, pink and white. All the kids are running around the tables in our Sunday
        best, and here comes Cousin Mikey, skinny, quiet, and so sad. You were the saddest boy I’d ever seen. You looked
        like a ghost. And Ray comes over and gives him a big old hug and says… What did he say?”</p>
    <p>Michael unlocked his jaw. “Welcome to the family.”</p>
    <p>“What was that like for you?” I asked.</p>
    <p>“It was wonderful.” He paused. “Ray looked just like him. It was like my dad was alive again.”</p>
    <p>“Ray was the best uncle,” Regina’s voice dripped with bitterness. “He played his part just right.&nbsp;He told
        childhood stories about Reggie, and he treated Michael like the son he’d always wanted and deserved. His real
        sons, not so much. They didn’t get the special treatment.”</p>
    <p>Michael’s expression went back to unreadable. “I didn’t ask for it.”</p>
    <p>“I know,” she said.&nbsp;“None of this is your fault, Mike.&nbsp;You know I love you.&nbsp;All of us love you.
        But you should know that since that day our lives turned into community theater.&nbsp;We prepped for your
        visits.&nbsp;When you were over, everything had to be perfect. And none of us resented it. It was nice.
        Especially, because after a while you weren’t sad anymore and some of us thought it was helping.”</p>
    <p>“I still was,” he said.&nbsp;“I learned to hide it better.”</p>
    <p>Regina nodded.&nbsp;“I thought as much. There was a lot of hiding happening. Ray decided to divorce Mama and
        marry Serenity instead, so he could adopt Michael and finally get to be the Head of a House. He hedged his bets,
        of course.&nbsp;He didn’t start with the divorce, he started with proposal, and Aunt Serenity shut him down flat
        and then called my mother. It was almost too much for Mama.”&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Regina’s voice turned soft.</p>
    <p>“The way Mama was raised, you got married once before the Lord and you stayed married until death do you part.
        She almost left, but Ray worked on her and got her to stay. He’s good with crying on demand.”</p>
    <p>She’d packed the world of meaning into that “worked on her.” Ray Latimer really was a slimeball.</p>
    <p>A hint of suspicion flared in Michael’s eyes.&nbsp;Whatever he was thinking, he must have found it troubling.</p>
    <p>Regina glanced at Michael. “Ray had to accept that the best he would get is telling people that he’s your uncle,
        so he turned his attention back to us, his children. Since none of us were Primes, he expected us to marry and
        start popping out Prime babies.”</p>
    <p>“He sounds obsessed,” I said.</p>
    <p>“That’s the perfect word for it,” Regina said.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Michael sighed.</p>
    <p>“None of us went along with it,” Regina said. “Alex and Deon ran away to the military.&nbsp;Alisha married for
        love, and neither of her kids are Primes. Her father-in-law is a Senator, and Ray can’t mess with her. Besides,
        it appeals to his pride. Dayanara doesn’t want kids, so she paid for a fake medical assessment that said she was
        infertile. I was Ray’s last chance. I’m the youngest and the strongest.”</p>
    <p>I got a sick feeling. The expression on Michael’s face told me he didn’t like where this was going either.</p>
    <p>“Ray had big plans for me. You should have seen the freak out he had when I told him I was a lesbian. He told me
        I was a sinner and an abomination and that I was going to hell. Then he threatened to disown me.”</p>
    <p>Michael drew back. “What?”</p>
    <p>Regina laughed.</p>
    <p>I didn’t know what to say.</p>
    <p>“He brought in some crazy preacher to give me special counselling to get me ‘right with God.’ He had my grandma
        call me and cry on the phone. Every day was some new thing. If I refused, he’d lock me out of the workshop. You
        know what that does to our kind.”</p>
    <p>The muscles along Michael’s jaw bulged.</p>
    <p>“When Ray figured out that I wouldn’t bend, he told me it was okay for me to keep Patricia on the side as long as
        I got married. He had a House in mind. I said no. I wouldn’t do that to Patricia, to the man I was supposed to
        marry, and most importantly, to myself. I’m a person. I’m not a bargaining chip or a baby factory. He put me on
        house arrest.”</p>
    <p>“He what?” Michael snarled.</p>
    <p>“I had an ankle bracelet like a criminal. If I left the property, his security goons would come to get me. He was
        not losing his last chance, you see.”</p>
    <p>Michael looked like he wanted to break something. “How long did it go on?”</p>
    <p>“All together? About eight months. You were in France. You didn’t know. He might have broken me if I hadn’t met
        Patricia. Her love gave me strength. Without her I would’ve ended up in a psych ward.”</p>
    <p>Michael reached for his pocket.</p>
    <p>“Don’t touch that phone, Mike.” She shook her head.&nbsp;“I’m not finished. One night Ray and I had a heart to
        heart. He told me that he would let me go, and I could be with Patricia, and I didn’t have to marry someone I
        didn’t love, but he wanted me to have kids. He wanted me to have children and give the children to him to raise.
        I didn’t have to ever see them. He would have full custody. He told me to think about it, because the next step
        would be harvesting my eggs.”</p>
    <p>“No.” It just came out of me.</p>
    <p>“Oh yes. He left, and then Mama came to see me. &nbsp;She brought her spiders.&nbsp;She told me to take what I
        could carry, and she and I walked out of that house. They tried to stop us, but we hit them hard. Uncle Deon was
        waiting for us with a car. He and Mama took me straight to the airport, and when I got there, Patricia met me at
        the gate. The next morning, we landed in Poland, and Ray woke up to a divorce filed by the best lawyer Mama’s
        family could hire. Mama had been preparing for it for months.”</p>
    <p>She leaned back, her tone light. &nbsp;&nbsp;“See, the problem wasn’t escaping.&nbsp;The problem was keeping Ray
        from chasing after us. Mama had his legal assets frozen, but he has plenty of money he hid over the years.
        Wherever we went, he made sure to screw things up for us.&nbsp;He ruined my wife’s reputation. Fraud, blackmail,
        nothing was off limits. By the time we came here, nobody would hire her.&nbsp;She is so good at what she does,
        Michael, and she loves it the way we love breathing life into things we make.&nbsp;He almost took it from her.”
    </p>
    <p>Michael’s face was terrible. He was keeping a lid on it, but he was thinking murder. I could see it in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>“The only reason he hasn’t come after us full force is because Mama kept dragging the divorce out as long as she
        could.&nbsp;But it’s coming to an end now.”</p>
    <p>Regina’s face turned hard.&nbsp;She’d been angry for so long, the anger had crystallized into armor.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“If I ever have children, they won’t know his face. He will never get his claws on them. Ever. He won’t be
        screwing up any of my babies with his bullshit. I’ll kill him first.</p>
    <p>“Why didn’t you come to me?” Michael asked.&nbsp;His voice was gentle. “Do you not trust me? I could’ve helped
        you.”</p>
    <p>“Of course, I trust you. And I care for you.&nbsp;But none of this is about you.”</p>
    <p>“What does that mean?”</p>
    <p>
        Regina leaned forward. “If I asked for your help, my father would submit. But he would do it because
        <em>you</em>
        asked him. Not because I told him to stop or because it was wrong.&nbsp;Not because he loved me.&nbsp;He would
        do it because it would threaten his relationship with you. It would change nothing, Michael. He still thinks he
        has done nothing wrong.&nbsp;He would find some other way to torment me, and I am <em>done</em>
        with his fucking bullshit. I’m better than him.”
    </p>
    <p>She waved her hand encompassing the conference room.&nbsp;“See all this? There are no saviors here. House Baylor
        isn’t sheltering me or Patricia. They were desperate to hire her and yes, we were desperate for her to get
        hired, but this isn’t charity, it’s a business arrangement. They stay out of my business, and I stay out of
        theirs. They value my wife, because she is the best there is and they would be lost without her.”</p>
    <p>“That’s true,” I said.</p>
    <p>“I don’t need a rescue.&nbsp;Mama and I already rescued ourselves. I need to be acknowledged. &nbsp;I am a
        person, Michael.&nbsp;I’m a power, and that asshole will recognize me.&nbsp;He will respect me, and he will fear
        me. So no, I did not go to you for help. I don’t need you to stand up for me.&nbsp;I’m standing up for myself.”
    </p>
    <p>She leaned forward and rested her hand on his.&nbsp;“I know what you have done.&nbsp;I know all about the abuse
        shelters and the charity and how important it is to you. If I came to you, you would’ve crushed him.&nbsp;Look
        at yourself.&nbsp;You can barely keep your hands away from your phone.&nbsp;At heart, you are a protector, Mike,
        and what I’ve told you made you very angry.&nbsp;I understand that, but I need you to stay out of my
        business.&nbsp;I must do this on my own.”</p>
    <p>Silence fell.</p>
    <p>We waited.</p>
    <p>
        “Okay,” Michael said. “I won’t make calls. I won’t crush him. I <em>really </em>
        want to, but I won’t. Is there any way I can I help you?”
    </p>
    <p>“Well, not bullying my wife’s employer would be a good start,” Regina said. “You brought a Class X construct
        inside the walls.”</p>
    <p>I looked at her.</p>
    <p>“His car,” she said. “It’s a murder machine. It’s alive and it transforms into a slaughter construct.”</p>
    <p>I turned to Michael and spread my hands.</p>
    <p>“I was told she was being held against her will.”</p>
    <p>“They are involved in something heavy, and you were misled,” Regina said.&nbsp;“You are one more thing these
        people can throw at the Baylors. I’ve had months and months in a workshop building whatever I want. If I wanted
        to leave, they couldn’t stop me even if they tried, and they wouldn’t try. I love you, cousin. Thank you for
        coming to check on me, but I am fine.”</p>
    <p>“So that’s it?” he asked.</p>
    <p>“It would be really nice if you stayed for dinner,” she said.&nbsp;“I’d like you to meet Patricia.”</p>
    <p>He pretended to consider it. “What did you make?”</p>
    <p>“Italian. Roulade with bacon and basil, whole wheat pasta, and salad.”</p>
    <p>“Well, I’m not the one to turn down bacon,” he said.</p>
    <p>She smiled at him. “I’ll show you my army.”</p>
    <p>“You have an army?” I asked.</p>
    <p>“Of course, I do.&nbsp;I’ve been working on them since before we moved. I am almost done.” Regina’s smile
        sharpened. “It’s my war, and when Ray comes sniffing around, I intend to fight it.”</p>
    <p>Michael turned to me.</p>
    <p>“You’re welcome to spend time in our home, Prime Latimer,” I said. “Take all the time you need.”</p>
    <p>“Thank you,” he said.</p>
    <p>Regina and he rose.&nbsp;Cinder stretched at the door, a perfect imitation of a real cat, and followed them out.
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>I listened to the receding sound of their steps and Cinder’s claws.</p>
    <p>The office fell silent.</p>

    <p>George: Mr. Montgomery, welcome.&nbsp;My name is George Camarine and I will be your interviewer today.</p>
    <p>Augustine: It’s a pleasure.</p>
    <p>George: Coffee? Dessert?</p>
    <p>Augustine: Yes, to both, thank you.  The entremet looks delightful.</p>
    <p>George: Doesn’t it? Raspberry and white chocolate with mascarpone mousse.&nbsp;The chef here is truly heavenly,
        and apparently a certain someone told him you are fond of these particular flavors.</p>
    <p>Augustine: Ah, yes, the infamous Arabella interview. I &#8217;m surprised the inn survived.</p>
    <p>George: How did this mentor-mentee relationship come about?</p>
    <p>Augustine: We had contracted a job out to the Baylor Investigative Agency, and they sent her to quibble about our
        referral fee. You might say I recognized a kindred soul. One could easily mistake her primary motivation being
        money, but it’s deeper than that.&nbsp;She strives for personal excellence. Money is simply a tangible measure
        of winning. Being successful isn’t enough. She wants to be so successful that she becomes a household name. Her
        sisters hide from fame, but Arabella seeks it out.</p>
    <p>George: That can be a dangerous inclination.</p>
    <p>Augustine: Very.&nbsp;Which was one of the reasons I took an interest. She needed guidance.</p>
    <p>George: The situation with the Baylors is rather complicated, isn’t it?</p>
    <p>Augustine: An understatement.</p>
    <p>George: Or perhaps an opening to a discussion.</p>
    <p>Augustine: Very well. I met Nevada at a difficult point in my life. I had just fended off a particularly vicious
        attack on House Montgomery. My brother was taken. I had been stabbed several times. There was extensive blood
        loss, and it wasn’t clear at the time if I would regain the full use of my left arm. It’s not a particularly
        prudent thing to admit for a man in my field. I was at the end of my rope and maintaining an illusion of perfect
        health and working arms proved quite challenging.</p>
    <p>I had to return to the office, to reassure our employees, to send a message to our enemies, and most importantly
        to coordinate the search for my sibling. We had to find Tarquin at all costs.</p>
    <p>Instead, I’d arrived at my office that morning to be greeted by House Pierce having histrionics in my waiting
        room. Not taking the case wasn’t an option. We owed Peter a favor, and he’d come to collect.&nbsp;In Prime
        society, business runs on favors, and you are only as good as your ability to pay up. This is something that I
        had to impart onto Arabella.&nbsp;Raw power matters, but base matters more.&nbsp;Can you pick up the phone and
        call someone you haven’t spoken to in two years and compel them to do something that wouldn’t be profitable for
        them either to balance the books or to owe them a favor?&nbsp;Would they take that call?&nbsp;That’s what being
        a Prime power means.</p>
    <p>I was the only one among the MII personnel who could’ve taken down Adam, and it would’ve been very difficult. I
        had to buy time, so I asked for the subcontractor with the best performance and got the Baylors. I gave them a
        cursory glance, because my time was in short supply, and they seemed to fit the bill. The plan was never to have
        them take down Pierce.&nbsp;I simply needed the appearance of an active investigation and I counted on them
        being smart enough to keep from getting hurt.</p>
    <p>Had I known Nevada would take this at face value, I would have…&nbsp;No, you know what, I would have done
        everything the same. In that particular state of mind, with what I knew at the time, I would’ve still made that
        decision, because that’s who I was back then.</p>
    <p>George: But you are not that man now?</p>
    <p>Augustine: My priorities have undergone a certain shift. The old adage says that if you beat a dog long enough,
        it will become vicious. I had been beaten for years in many ways. I had sunk very deep into the cycle of
        retaliation and preemptive measures. It took a catastrophic event to spark some self-awareness.</p>
    <p>George: Connor threatening to kill you?</p>
    <p>Augustine: Not that. That I had expected at the time. No, it was the fact that Nevada came to me. In her place, I
        would’ve eliminated me. It was cleaner and safer, while the alternative was messy and had questionable chances
        of success. She sat in my office, and I could tell that she was deeply conflicted.&nbsp;That woman genuinely
        didn’t want to hurt me. It was another way to be. A way I used to be a long time ago and had forgotten.&nbsp;I
        used to be idealistic. I used to be very sure in the kind of man I wanted to be. Alas, House warfare doesn’t
        suffer idealists.</p>
    <p>George: Do you like yourself more now?</p>
    <p>Augustine: I’d like to think so. I have drawn some lines, which I will not cross.</p>
    <p>George: Did you recover your brother?</p>
    <p>Augustine: Yes.&nbsp;He survived.</p>
    <p>George: And your father’s killer.</p>
    <p>
        Augustine: <em>smiling.</em>
    </p>
    <p>George: I see. Can you tell us a bit more about your family?</p>
    <p>Augustine: I have two siblings and a cousin, whom I’ve taken in.</p>
    <p>George: Are you romantically involved with anyone.</p>
    <p>Augustine: Yes.</p>
    <p>George: Is that all we’re going to get?&nbsp;No details?</p>
    <p>Augustine: Yes.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;George: In that case, let’s move on to a less sensitive subject.&nbsp;Konstantine Berezin.</p>
    <p>
        Augustine: <em>laughs.</em>
    </p>
    <p>George: Is he as good as he claims to be?</p>
    <p>Augustine: Yes.</p>
    <p>George: As good as you?</p>
    <p>Augustine: No.</p>
    <p>George: Why?</p>
    <p>Augustine: Konstantin maintains his illusions sporadically during missions and in his spare time, for fun. I
        spent two years of my life pretending to be my dead father in front of high level Illusion mages on our payroll.
        I’ve had significantly more practice and my stakes were a lot higher.</p>
    <p>George: Will we ever learn more about that?</p>
    <p>Augustine: If they give me a book, you will.&nbsp;Without any false modesty, I believe I would be quite
        profitable for them.</p>
    <p>George: False modesty serves no one.</p>
    <p>Augustine: Indeed.&nbsp;So, tell me about yourself.&nbsp;What is it like to be married?</p>
    <p>George: It is bliss. Let us conclude this interview and I will tell you all about it. Dear readers, thank you for
        joining us for another addition of FrInnday.</p>
