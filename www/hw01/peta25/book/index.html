    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
        “Ilona Andrews” is the pseudonym for a husband-and-wife writing team. Ilona is a native-born Russian and Gordon
        is a former communications sergeant in the U.S. Army. Contrary to popular belief, Gordon was never an
        intelligence officer with a license to kill, and Ilona was never the mysterious Russian spy who seduced him.
        They met in college, in English Composition 101, where Ilona got a better grade. (Gordon is still sore about
        that.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Gordon and Ilona currently reside in Texas with their two children and many dogs and cats.
    </p>
    <p>
        They have co-authored several bestselling series, including the #1 NYT bestselling urban fantasy of Kate
        Daniels, rustic fantasy of the Edge, paranormal romance of Hidden Legacy, and Innkeeper Chronicles, which they
        post as a free weekly serial. For complete list of their books, fun extras, and Innkeeper installments, please
