    <p><em>A deleted scene from SAPPHIRE FLAMES that became a short story for you.</em></p>

    <p>Some days just suck.</p>
    <p>First, I found a stain on the cute dress I planned to wear today. Then I spilled my coffee.&nbsp;Then I hit my
        toe on the door frame to the office.&nbsp;I really wanted to kick the door, but the last time I hit the back of
        my head and then punched the offending surface, I had to lie to Catalina and claim that a support beam in the
        abandoned building spontaneously collapsed.&nbsp;If it was my oldest sister instead of my second oldest sister,
        I wouldn’t get away with it. Nevada knew when you lied to her.&nbsp;Catalina totally believed me.</p>
    <p>Lying to Catalina wasn’t a habit I cultivated.&nbsp;Oh, I lied casually all the time and never got caught but
        lying to Catalina was like kicking a baby deer. It made me feel guilty and I avoided feeling guilty whenever
        possible. But my family just now relaxed enough to stop continuously worrying I would change my shape and be
        killed because of it. I didn’t want to heap more onto the worry pile.</p>
    <p>I was supposed
        to be working on the case Catalina took for her friend and I was making good
        progress when Leon called.&nbsp;Leon was my
        younger cousin.&nbsp;Mom had adopted him and
        my older cousin, Bern, on account of my aunt being a heinous bitch, and they
        were more like my brothers.&nbsp;One time I
        called Bern brother-cousin in public and then we had to leave the wedding
        reception for Mom’s friend because everyone kept giving us weird looks. It was
        hilarious.</p>
    <p>Leon kept the
        call short.&nbsp;“I fucked up. Come help me
        and Grandma. Don’t tell Catalina.”</p>
    <p>I wasn’t
        planning on telling Catalina.&nbsp;She had
        her hands full.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A quick
        investigation revealed that Grandma Frida was gone and so was the Brick.&nbsp;The armored vehicle was her new
        baby.&nbsp;She took one of the Humvees we claimed when
        some idiots attacked our warehouse and spent the last three years turning it
        into an indestructible monstrosity.&nbsp;She
        never let any of us drive it, which meant that Leon must’ve called her first
        and she took the Brick and went to help him.</p>
    <p>Leon had been
        working the Yarrow case, named so because of the subdivision where the woman he
        was investigating lived. I didn’t know much about it except that the woman
        worked as an accountant and apparently embezzled money from her friends’
        businesses.&nbsp;None of that required either
        Grandma Frida or the Brick.</p>
    <p>I jumped into
        my car and drove to the address he texted.</p>
    <p>Yarrow Northwest
        was a master-planned community in Katy, which was technically its own city west
        of Houston.&nbsp;In reality, Houston sprawled
        in all directions, like some giant amoeba that gobbled up the neighboring
        municipalities.&nbsp;It swallowed Katy a while
        ago and now there was no way to tell where Houston ended, and Katy began.</p>
    <p>
        The Yarrow
        boasted about seventy homesites, all featuring EcoSmart technology, large
        yards, amenities like tennis courts and an onsite waterpark with slides and a
        lazy river, and prices of a million and a half and up.&nbsp;According to Leon, they actually measured the
        grass on each lawn with a ruler.&nbsp;It was so
        trendy, it made me want to spray paint unicorns pooping rainbows in their
        driveways just to add some life to the place.&nbsp;Buying a house in Yarrow made a statement.&nbsp;<em>I am
            successful.&nbsp;Look at my house, look at my beautiful
            family, look at our lazy river and our precision trimmed lawn and perfect
            little flowers and despair, for we are better than you.</em>
    </p>
    <p>Who would want
        to float in their lazy river anyway?</p>
    <p>Logically I
        could think of some reasons why someone would want to live in a place like
        that, but it wasn’t for me.&nbsp;We worked too
        hard for our money.&nbsp;When we bought a
        house, nobody would tell us how long our grass could be, what color we could paint
        the walls, or where we could park out cars.&nbsp;If I wanted a turret on my roof, I would get a damn turret…</p>
    <p>When we bought
        a house… All of us had been working very hard toward that magical house, but so
        far we hadn’t found a good one.&nbsp;A house
        would solve a lot of our security problems. The warehouse wasn’t defensible,
        and we were all too old to live together.&nbsp;Bern had to be dying for his own place. Leon, too. Trouble was we
        needed
        something large enough for all of us and secure, and while there was plenty of
        mansions and compound around Houston, there wasn’t much available in our price
        range. Catalina had gone a little crazy trying to get this taken care of and I
        watched her closely.&nbsp;We didn’t need the
        repeat of the other incident.</p>
    <p>I took the
        exit, drove up the road to the side street, and took a short picturesque drive
        to the gated entrance of Yarrow. &nbsp;I
        smiled at the guard in the booth and punched a code into the digital
        display.&nbsp;The heavy iron gates parted,
        and I steered the Mercedes through.&nbsp;The
        guard smiled back as I drove in. The car was fancy enough and I looked the part
        – a pretty nineteen year old blonde in a designer grey dress driving a
        Mercedes.</p>
    <p>“Call Leon.”</p>
    <p>The phone rang,
        and my cousin answered through the car’s speaker.&nbsp;“Are you almost here?”</p>
    <p>“I’m in the
        neighborhood.&nbsp;Which house is it?”</p>
    <p>“Keep
        going.&nbsp;You’ll see it.” He hung up.</p>
    <p>And that wasn’t
        ominous.&nbsp;At all.</p>
    <p>I guided the
        car down the lane.&nbsp;To the left of me, a
        beautifully landscaped median offered flowerbeds and picturesque shrubs.&nbsp;To the right, driveways peeled
        off, each
        leading to a walled estate secured by an identical gate.</p>
    <p>
        <em>You’ll see it. </em>
    </p>
    <p>All houses
        looked the same.&nbsp;Some had stucco, some
        were brick but at the core, they were all the same, slightly modified version
        of a McMansion…</p>
    <p>The house on my
        right was missing the gate.&nbsp;That fact
        took a second for register, and I drove right past it.&nbsp;I reversed and backed up.&nbsp;The gate lay in the
        inner yard, twisted.&nbsp;Past it, a large vehicle-shaped hole gaped
        where the front door should have been.</p>
    <p>Damn it, Leon.</p>
    <p>
        I turned into
        the driveway, leaned forward as drove up to the hole, and peered through the
        windshield.&nbsp;The interior of the house
        was darker than the outside, but I saw the unmistakable blocky outline of
        Brick’s rear.&nbsp;The Humvee was <em>in</em>
        the house.&nbsp;The damages.&nbsp;So many damages.
    </p>
    <p>Catalina would
        kill him.&nbsp;And I would hold him while she
        bashed his head in.</p>
    <p>I shut off the
        engine and went inside.&nbsp;The place had a
        wide foyer.&nbsp;Twin staircases hugged the
        opposite walls, leading upstairs to a unified landing.&nbsp;Two black tire marks stretched from the front
        door, across the shiny grey marble floor, across a beige oriental rug, all the
        way to where Brick now waited in front of a steel door.&nbsp;The door looked really out of place in the
        upscale house and sported a big dent.&nbsp;A
        panic room.&nbsp;Great.</p>
    <p>They had driven
        the Humvee through the front door, through the foyer, through the sitting room
        and half of the damn house, and then they rammed it into the steel door.</p>
    <p>Damn it. Damn it with sprinkles on top.</p>
    <p>Grandma Frida
        sat on top of Brick looking bored.&nbsp;To
        the right, shirtless Leon rested on the floor, leaning against a coffee table
        that had somehow survived the vehicular assault.&nbsp;His T-shirt, once white and now bloodstained,
        was wrapped around his head. A white man in his mid-thirties frantically paced
        back and forth around a white couch as if trying to wear a hole in the rug.</p>
    <p>“Have you all
        lost your minds?”&nbsp;It seemed like a fair
        question.</p>
    <p>Leon pointed to
        the man.&nbsp;“His fault.”</p>
    <p>I looked at the
        man.&nbsp;“Who are you?”</p>
    <p>The man stopped
        pacing and looked at me for the first time.&nbsp;“I’m Kent.&nbsp;Kent Mills.&nbsp;I live here. This is my
        house.”</p>
    <p>He was the
        suspect’s spouse.</p>
    <p>“What
        happened?”</p>
    <p>Leon gave me an
        exhausted look. “This is Kent Mills. He works as a registered nurse. This is
        his house, except it’s actually being foreclosed on because his wife, Sandra
        Mills, who is our suspect, failed to pay the mortgage.&nbsp;For six months.”</p>
    <p>
        <em>“I did pay the
            mortgage!”</em>
        a woman’s voice shrieked through the speaker above the steel
        door.&nbsp;<em>“It’s a misunderstanding!”</em>
    </p>
    <p>Kent spun
        toward the door.&nbsp;“Oh yes, another one of
        your famous ‘misunderstandings.’&nbsp;It’s a
        clerical error, it’s a computer glitch, and you’ll call them tomorrow and
        straighten this right out.”</p>
    <p>
        <em>“You’re a bastard,
            Kent.&nbsp;A stupid, selfish bastard!”</em>
    </p>
    <p>Kent sucked in
        a lung full of air.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I used my best
        impersonation of Mom’s voice.&nbsp;“Shut it.”</p>
    <p>He clicked his mouth closed.</p>
    <p>I turned to
        Leon.&nbsp;“How did Brick get in the house?”</p>
    <p>“I’m getting to
        that.&nbsp;We were hired by The Shaw
        Distillery to investigate possible embezzlement. I determined that their
        bookkeeper, Sandra, was robbing them blind.”</p>
    <p>
        <em>“That’s a lie
            and I’ll sue you for libel,”</em>
        Sandra screamed through the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>“That suit will
        be thrown out, because it should be slander, not libel,” I said.&nbsp;“If you’re going to threaten someone, at
        least do it correctly.”</p>
    <p>“I looked into
        the other businesses she did the books for,” Leon said.&nbsp;“She befriended people, convinced them to let
        her handle their books, at a friend discount, and then stole everything they
        had.”</p>
    <p>
        <em>“That’s another
            lie.&nbsp;I’m telling you, it’s a
            misunderstanding.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>Leon rolled his
        eyes.&nbsp;“A lie the way your MBA is a lie?”</p>
    <p>Kent
        blinked.&nbsp;“Wait, what?&nbsp;I saw the diploma from UT. It’s in the
        office.”</p>
    <p>“Fake,” Leon
        said.&nbsp;“She has an Accounting Certificate
        from Houston Community College.&nbsp;UT has
        no record of her ever attending.”</p>
    <p>
        <em>“It’s a –”</em>
    </p>
    <p>“A
        misunderstanding!” Grandma Frida, Leon, and Kent finished in unison.</p>
    <p>“Get to the
        part where the two of you drove the car into the house.”</p>
    <p>Grandma Frida
        drew herself straight.&nbsp;“It’s not a
        car.&nbsp;It’s an armored assault vehicle.”
        She petted Brick’s roof.&nbsp;“You don’t
        listen to her.&nbsp;You are a magnificent
        beast.”</p>
    <p>I had to strain
        to not shake my fists at them.</p>
    <p>“I found nine
        businesses she defrauded for a total of eight million dollars,” Leon said.</p>
    <p>“Eight
        million?”&nbsp;Really?</p>
    <p>“She’s been
        doing it for years.”</p>
    <p>“Eight million,
        Sandy, and you couldn’t pay the mortgage?!” Kent roared.</p>
    <p>
        <em>“It was
            fine!&nbsp;It was all fine until you ruined
            it!”</em>
    </p>
    <p>“Where did the
        money go?” Kent demanded.</p>
    <p>“She bought a
        winery,” Leon said.&nbsp;“Seriously, who does
        that?”</p>
    <p>“Sandy!&nbsp;What the hell do you know about wine?”</p>
    <p>
        <em>“You never
            believed in me, Kent.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>My head began
        to throb.&nbsp;I rubbed my temples.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Leon heaved a sigh.&nbsp;“I came here to talk to give her a chance to
        come clean. At that point, Mr. Mills ran out, hysterically screaming that his
        wife had locked herself in the panic room with his little girl.”</p>
    <p>A child?&nbsp;These two had a child?</p>
    <p>“So you called
        Grandma, talked her into driving Brick here, and rammed it through the house
        into the panic room?&nbsp;Do you have any
        idea the conversation Catalina will have to have with our insurance company?”</p>
    <p>Leon waved his
        arms. “I did my due diligence. First, I had him formally hire us. He signed a
        waiver absolving us from any liability resulting from damages to the
        property.&nbsp;Second, I called Grandma.&nbsp;I wanted to go with a blow torch.&nbsp;She decided that, and I
        quote, ‘ramming it is
        faster.’”</p>
    <p>“Grandma!”</p>
    <p>She
        shrugged.&nbsp;“The angle of approach wasn’t
        good.&nbsp;The Brick is wider than the door,
        so it’s hard to hit it right.”</p>
    <p>“You drove the
        Brick into the house! And you didn’t even break the door.”</p>
    <p>“How was I
        supposed to know she’d spent the money on ballistic resistant plate steel?”</p>
    <p>
        <em>“I deserve to
            have nice things, I work hard, and safety is important to me!”</em>
    </p>
    <p>“I was not
        consulted about said ramming,” Leon said.&nbsp;“I had to dive out of the way and hit my head on this stupid
        coffee
        table.”</p>
    <p>Argh! I wished
        I could growl but it would just freak everyone out.</p>
    <p>“Where is the
        child now?”</p>
    <p>“It’s not a
        child,” Grandma Frida said.</p>
    <p>Leon passed me
        a framed photograph.&nbsp;In it, Kent and
        Sandra held a white Persian cat.</p>
    <p>“That’s the
        name of the cat,” Leon informed me.&nbsp;“Little Girl.”</p>
    <p>I turned to
        Kent.&nbsp;“Why did your wife hide in the
        panic room?”</p>
    <p>Kent waved his arms. “Clint called and screamed at me that Sandra is a scammer and she bankrupted his bakery.
        Patrick from the winery had called him and Clint checked his accounts. I logged into our bank to see if there
        were any weird deposits and I found that we are broke.&nbsp;It’s worse than broke, we are in debt!&nbsp;Our
        personal credit lines are maxed out.&nbsp;Our mortgage hasn’t been paid since August. When I confronted her, she
        kidnapped my baby and ran into the panic room and now she’s threatening to hurt her!”</p>
    <p>
        <em>“Everything was
            fine until you decided to go digging!&nbsp;I
            gave you everything, and you just couldn’t leave it alone.&nbsp;Why can’t you believe me, Kent?”</em>
    </p>
    <p>“You stole from
        our friends! Everyone knows.&nbsp;Clint and
        Patrick called everybody!&nbsp;Everyone hates
        us.”</p>
    <p>
        <em>“I made their
            businesses.&nbsp;Every single one of them was
            failing until I helped them.&nbsp;They owe
            me.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>Kent looked at
        me.&nbsp;“I just want my cat back.”</p>
    <p>“Okay.”&nbsp;I walked up to the door.&nbsp;“Mrs. Mills, this is silly. You can’t stay in
        the panic room forever.”</p>
    <p>
        <em>“Yes, I can.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>“What would you
        like to happen?” I asked.&nbsp;“What would it
        take to get you to come out?”</p>
    <p>
        <em>“I want you all
            to go away.&nbsp;And I want everyone to
            apologize to me for lying about me.&nbsp;I
            want Patrick to come here and tell me how sorry he is that he made everyone mad
            at me.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>Denial was a
        terrible thing.</p>
    <p>I tried for my
        business voice. “Mrs. Mills, that’s not realistic.&nbsp;You embezzled a significant amount of
        money.&nbsp;That’s an irrefutable fact
        provable by financial records and bank statements.&nbsp;No amount of apologies will make it go away.”</p>
    <p>
        <em>“What do you
            people want from me?&nbsp;I do
            everything.&nbsp;Do you want my blood, is
            that it?&nbsp;Do you want blood sacrifice?”</em>
    </p>
    <p>“Nobody wants
        that.&nbsp;We want you to be healthy and
        uninjured.&nbsp;Why don’t you come out and we
        can talk about it? I’m sure you were under a great deal of stress.&nbsp;We all make mistakes.&nbsp;As you said,
        maybe it is all a
        misunderstanding.”</p>
    <p>Kent rolled his
        eyes. Leon made money counting gestures.</p>
    <p>
        <em>&nbsp;“You know what I think?”</em>
        &nbsp;Sandra asked, a vicious note in her
        voice.&nbsp;<em>“I think you’re a conniving
            little bitch.&nbsp;You can tell that bastard
            that I will break every bone in his piece of shit cat’s body.&nbsp;He loves her more than me anyway.”</em>
    </p>
    <p>Who wouldn’t? I
        looked at the door.&nbsp;It seemed standard:
        solid, with a wheel that rotated, and probably multiple steel bars that secured
        it when the wheel was turned.&nbsp;Once she
        locked it from the inside, the wheel wouldn’t move.</p>
    <p>“Leon, call
        Sgt. Munoz and let him know that we are about to have an incident. I need all
        of you to leave the building and not peek.&nbsp;I want to have a private conversation with Sandra.”</p>
    <p>They looked at
        me.</p>
    <p>“Do you want
        her out of that room or not?”&nbsp;I made
        shooing motions with my hands. “Go on.”</p>
    <p>“I want to…”
        Kent started.</p>
    <p>“Please
        leave.&nbsp;Your baby is counting on you.”</p>
    <p>I watched the
        three of them walk out of the building. The thing about metamorphosis mages was
        that everyone thought we were one trick ponies.&nbsp;We turned into monsters and sometimes went nuts.&nbsp;But
        there was more to it.&nbsp;So much more.</p>
    <p>I pulled on my
        magic.&nbsp;It tried to bury me like an
        avalanche, a glowing mess of rainbow colors, churning together.&nbsp;I picked just one, the dark red one, and
        let
        it fill me.&nbsp;The blood-red shadow of the
        Beast that was my other form filled my mind, colossal, shaggy, with eyes that
        glowed pure white.</p>
    <p>“You wouldn’t really hurt a little cat, would you?” I stretched my shoulders.</p>
    <p>
        <em>“Watch me!”</em>
    </p>
    <p>“Have it your
        way.”</p>
    <p>I gripped the
        wheel and strained.&nbsp;In my head the Beast
        roared. Metal snapped with a sharp clang inside the door. The wheel gave with a
        grinding noise, the bars slid back, and I yanked the door open.</p>
    <p>Sandra Mills stared
        at me with freaked out eyes.&nbsp;She was
        white and thin, in her early thirties, with salon-dyed blonde hair and too much
        foundation that was two shades too yellow for her skin tone.&nbsp;Her sweatpants and an over-sized T-shirt hung
        on her bony shoulders.&nbsp;She clutched a white
        cat to her.</p>
    <p>She opened her
        mouth.&nbsp;Nothing came out.</p>
    <p>I reached over,
        grabbed the wheel, and snapped it off the door.</p>
    <p>Sandra jerked
        back.</p>
    <p>“I talked to you,
        and you came out on your own,” I told her.&nbsp;“If you say anything different…” I bent the wheel’s spokes with
        my
        hands.</p>
    <p>She nodded
        frantically.</p>
    <p>In the distance
        police siren wailed, getting closer.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Beast evaporated from my mind, as if swept by a wind. Fatigue took over. I winked at Sandra, took the cat,
        from her arms, and headed outside.&nbsp;I would have to spin a cute story for the cops, convince Leon and
        Grandma that the door must’ve been damaged by the Brick, and then I would have to call the insurance
        company.&nbsp;Catalina didn’t need one more headache.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I was the youngest kid in my family, but I was a Baylor. We always pulled our weight.</p>

        <figcaption>A woman i a business suit standing above a city at nightfall</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>I walked into the mansion of House Piney wearing my best
        “Pay Me” pant suit.&nbsp;Powder pink and
        slightly oversized yet still obviously tailored, it draped my body in an
        elegant way, complimented my tan skin, and hid the bruises on my arms. My dark
        hair rested in a conservative bun at the nape of my neck, my makeup was
        understated but expertly applied, and my shoes, plum-red Dior pumps, completed
        the look. My outfit said, “I don’t need your money, but I collect what’s owed
        to me. Take me seriously.”</p>
    <p>The outfit lied. We needed their money. Every cent of it.</p>
    <p>Behind me, Arabella wore a similar ensemble in pale grey
        with a turquoise blouse that contrasted nicely with her blonde hair. Nobody
        would ever guess that only a couple of hours ago my sister and I come home
        covered in blood and dirt.</p>
    <p>I’d learned this trick from my older sister.&nbsp;Like Nevada, I spent most of my business
        hours in jeans and a T-shirt, while my small but expensive wardrobe hung in the
        closet safely wrapped in plastic. Usually I only pulled it out twice during a
        case: first, when meeting the client and the second when collecting the
        payment. I’d come here once before and dressing up proved to be the right
        choice. House Piney was a second-generation House, practically a brand-new
        family by the standards of Houston magical elite. They were clearly insecure
        and deviation from the status-quo made them nervous. They would expect the Head
        of another House to flaunt their status, so I met and exceeded their
        expectations.</p>
    <p>The foyer of Piney home had that generically luxurious
        quality particular to newer Texas mansions: travertine tile sheathing the
        floor, spotless white walls, and an iron-railed staircase leading to the second
        floor. A safe decorating choice, uncomplicated by personal style and taste.</p>
    <p>A middle-aged white man stood guard by the staircase.&nbsp;He wore a three-piece black suit, white
        shirt, and a black tie and stood in a classic pose, one arm bent behind him,
        the other in front, with a white-gloved hand resting across his waist.
        Arabella’s eyebrows crept up. I shot her a warning look.</p>
    <p>The man gave me a short nod. “Good morning, Ms. Baylor.”</p>
    <p>“Good morning, Mr. Walt. This is my sister, Arabella
        Baylor,” I told him.</p>
    <p>“Very good, ma’am. Please wait in the sitting room.” He
        indicated a living room on our right with a swipe of his hand.</p>
    <p>We walked into the living room filled with ornate furniture.
        I’d sit down, but I’d fallen off the armored vehicle last night and my butt
        hurt.&nbsp;If I sat, I’d need help getting
        up.</p>
    <p>“A butler,” my sister murmured under her breath. “Do we have
        brandy and cigars now or after they pay us?”</p>
    <p>“They would probably serve us tea and cucumber sandwiches.
        You can have brandy and cigars when you go to visit Linus next weekend.”</p>
    <p>Unlike the Pineys, Linus Duncan was a fourth-generation
        Prime and for reasons I didn’t understand, he doted on us like we were his
        grandchildren. Arabella took shameless advantage of that.</p>
    <p>The sound of light feminine giggling drifted from deeper
        within the house. Four people emerged from the other room.&nbsp;Two young women in late teens, both
        Caucasian, one in a white dress, the other in a pink. Two men in their early
        twenties, one white and blond and the other dark-haired and Latino, accompanied
        them.</p>
    <p>The woman in white was Brittney Pine, the youngest child of
        House Piney. The blond guy next to her was Robert Taylor, House Taylor, Lux
        mage. Robert created fluorescence, anything from a gentle colored glow to a
        blinding light, and could attach it to inanimate objects. The other man and the
        girl in pink didn’t look familiar. All four had that polished House brat look.
        Life had been kind to them so far and they had no fear she would change her
        mind.</p>
    <p>The girls glanced at us and giggled.</p>
    <p>Arabella rolled her eyes.</p>
    <p>The foursome landed on the couches at the other end of the
        room and spoke in hushed voices. We were an oddity. Arabella was their age, I
        was only a couple of years older, and we were members of the magic elite, but
        while they lived a carefree existence wrapped in luxury, we worked, and their
        parents took us seriously. Furthermore, our records had been sealed by our
        request. Both Arabella and I were Primes, the highest rank of magic user, but
        the exact nature of our magic remained hidden.</p>
    <p>A faint tendril of magic brushed against my mind. Brittney
        turned away quickly and snickered.</p>
    <p>House Piney were telepaths. They could communicate with each
        other over great distances and they could scan hundreds of people at once,
        picking up surface thoughts. They specialized in providing confidential
        communication to large corporations. They couldn’t penetrate one’s mind and
        pull a secret out, however, which was why they now owed us money.</p>
    <p>Another feather-light touch. Strong but clumsy. Compared to
        what I grew up with, this was amateur hour.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;“Handle her,” Arabella ground out. “Handle her, or I will.”</p>
    <p>Another touch. This was a huge breach of etiquette. If she
        did it to the wrong mental mage, she would start a war with another House. As a
        Prime, I was expected to react. I had to cut this short.</p>
    <p>I lowered my mental defenses and remembered the first person I ever killed. The man’s dark silhouette in a
        ballistic vest loomed in front of me, his head turned away.</p>
    <p>I lunged. The blade of my sword sliced his throat, cutting the jugular and the carotid. Blood gushed, dark and
        hot. The metallic smell of it lanced my senses.</p>
    <p>I tasted acid on my tongue.</p>
    <p>The man choked, exhaling bloody mist out of his mouth…</p>
    <p>I yanked myself back to reality. Across the room, Brittney
        stared at me, wide-eyed. Her girlfriend pulled on her hand. “Hey?”</p>
    <p>I walked over to them, slowly, the sound of my heels
        measured on the travertine tile. My face had iced over. When I took over as
        Head of the House, this expression didn’t come naturally to me. It’d been six
        months and now it required no effort.</p>
    <p>Brittney shrank from me.</p>
    <p>“Would you like to see what’s in my head?” I asked quietly.</p>
    <p>Brittney shook her head.</p>
    <p>“It’s impolite to trespass in other people’s minds,”
        Arabella said, studying her nails.&nbsp;“Pull
        that stunt with the wrong person, and you’ll end up wearing diapers for the
        rest of your life, blissfully unaware that you are the sole survivor of House
        Piney.”</p>
    <p>Harsh but true.</p>
    <p>Brittney’s girlfriend opened her mouth. I looked at her,
        loading enough derision into my gaze to make a whole ballroom of debutantes
        wither. She clamped her teeth shut.</p>
    <p>A quick staccato of steps running down the stairs came from
        above. “Brittney!” A sharp male voice cracked like a whip.</p>
    <p>Arabella smiled. “Uh oh.”</p>
    <p>John Piney, Brittney’s older brother, charged into the room.</p>
    <p>Robert turned to him. “Hi John…”</p>
    <p>“Shut the fuck up, Bob. Why are you here?”</p>
    <p>Bob recoiled, stunned.</p>
    <p>John pivoted to his sister. “Are you high or have you lost
        your mind?”</p>
    <p>“Don’t talk to her like that!” the other girl piped up.</p>
    <p>John glared at her. “Leave. Now.”</p>
    <p>She gasped.</p>
    <p>Bob finally snapped out of his shocked stupor. “I have to go
        do something.”</p>
    <p>John turned to him. “Are you still here?”</p>
    <p>The three friends took off for the front door. John stared
        at his sister.</p>
    <p>Brittney turned red, then white. Clearly, a telepathic
        chewing out was taking place.</p>
    <p>“Sorry,” she said in a small voice.</p>
    <p>“It’s fine,” I told her.</p>
    <p>“Please accept our sincere apologies,” John said. “My
        parents will see you now.”</p>
    <p>Arabella and I followed him up the stairs into a study lined
        with mahogany shelves. Mr. Piney, a slender white man in his early fifties, sat
        in an overstuffed red chair that very much wanted to be a throne. Mrs. Piney,
        naturally pale with blonde hair and a generous figure, waited next to him, on
        her feet. John stood to the side.</p>
    <p>I unzipped the black leather folder I was carrying, opened
        it, and put it on the desk in front of them, revealing a printout with columns
        of numbers.</p>
    <p>“You’re right. Your nephew is stealing from you. He’s been
        doing it for the last three years. He occasionally issues bogus payments to
        your legitimate contractors. They refund him, and he then transfers the money
        into one of the private accounts. However, the main source of his embezzling is
        Raptor, Inc. It’s a shell corporation, no actual physical address, no assets.
        It’s presented as your subsidiary in the paperwork.”</p>
    <p>“I’ve never heard of it,” Mrs. Piney said.</p>
    <p>“What does this Raptor do?” Mr. Piney asked.</p>
    <p>“Currently it’s billing the Department of Defense for bogus
        expenses associated with your military contracts,” Arabella said.</p>
    <p>Silence.</p>
    <p>“I’m going to kill him,” John said, his voice disturbingly
        casual.</p>
    <p>In his place, I would try to kill his cousin too. Once the
        DoD discovered the fraud, House Piney could lose the entirety of their military
        contracts. Civilian jobs would follow. They would be ruined.</p>
    <p>I pointed at the paper inside the folder. “These are the
        twelve accounts he maintains, with current balances and passwords. You’ll find
        the digital copy on the usb in the pocket of the folder.”</p>
    <p>“How did you get this?” Mrs. Piney murmured, scanning the
        data.</p>
    <p>Her nephew had told it to me yesterday over dinner.&nbsp;He’d practically dislocated his fingers
        logging into his accounting software trying to impress me with his cleverness
        and wealth.</p>
    <p>“This is what we do,” I said. “Your nephew is unaware that
        we have this information. If you move quickly, you should be able to seize the
        assets before he liquidates them.</p>
    <p>Mr. Piney raised his head. “Who have you told about this?”</p>
    <p>
        <em>Oh no, you don’t. </em>
        “Our contract guarantees
        confidentiality. We do not disclose the information we obtain in the course of
        our investigations unless compelled to do so in a court of law.”
    </p>
    <p>Mr. Piney was still staring at me.</p>
    <p>
        I met his gaze. <em>Pay us and walk us to the front door, and
            you will live another day.</em>
    </p>
    <p>I was looking straight at him and I saw the exact moment his
        confidence faltered.</p>
    <p>Arabella stepped forward and held up her cell phone. “I’m
        ready for your transfer.”</p>

    <p>

    <p>I leaned toward the mirror and traced my lips with Les Beiges Healthy Glow Balm from Chanel. When you had big
        eyes and plump lips, you had to pick which one you drew attention to. My eyes were a light blue, the color most
        people achieved with contact lenses, and once I was done with eyeshadow and mascara, they popped. Any bright
        shade of lipstick took my face from pretty straight to clown. There were no stops in between. But the medium
        shade of the Chanel’s balm turned out to be my perfect pink. Not too much, not too little, just enough.</p>
    <p>Somebody was running down the hall like a small rhino. That was neither new nor unusual in our house. I ignored
        it and concentrated on contouring my top lip.</p>
    <p>Catalina burst into the bathroom. “Nevada’s in labor!”</p>
    <p>I dropped my balm into the sink. My oldest sister was due any day. Today was a really bad day. Catalina had found
        some sort of monster construct in the Pit, a flooded area of Houston. I was reasonably sure that she and Mr.
        Dreamboat, otherwise known as Alessandro Sagredo, her handsome Italian assassin/not-boyfriend, would go there
        today to kill it. I planned to help. What’s better than a monster? A bigger monster.</p>
    <p>I was also reasonably sure that Stephen Jiang would be there. Which was why I was taking my time putting on my
        face.</p>
    <p>“The thing in the Pit grabbed one of the Primes and is attacking the work site,” Catalina barked. “I have to go.
        Yesterday, Victoria threatened Nevada and the baby. Go with her and don’t let her out of your sight. If it all
        goes to shit, I don’t care if you are in the middle of that damn building, you transform, and you get them out
        of there.”</p>
    <p>Change of plans.</p>
    <p>This was the first baby for Nevada and for Connor. If I knew anything about my brother-in-law, he would
        overreact. That meant they wouldn’t take a car. They would take a helicopter. If I didn’t get a move on, he
        would stuff her into that helicopter and take off without me.</p>
    <p>I pushed past Catalina and sprinted to my room to get my shoes and my purse.</p>
    <p>In five seconds, I located four shoes. None of them matched. The only matching pair was the hideous pink crocs,
        which I wore when my feet hurt from high heels and nobody important could see me. Well, if I did transform, none
        of my good shoes would be ruined. I stuck my feet into the crocs, swiped the tiny purse with my wallet off the
        door handle, ran back to the bathroom to get my phone, which I had forgotten, because my sister had come in
        shrieking like a banshee, and dashed outside.</p>
    <p>I got there just as Connor half-helped, half-lifted my oldest sister into the Bell AH-3 Cobra. Some people owned
        luxury cars. Mad Rogan owned the latest model twin engine attack helicopters. Paranoid rich primes had the best
        toys.</p>
    <p>Connor saw me running toward them and waved to me to hurry up. I made it to the helicopter and climbed inside.
        Mom was already there, next to Nevada. I wedged into the seat between them. Connor hopped in, made sure we were
        all strapped in, and then we were off.</p>
    <p>The inside of the helicopter was loud. Connor passed out headsets with mics. I had one just like it for
        Battlefield Glory, so I could hear the people on my squad as we murdered the Alien &nbsp;Crimson Armada. Cool.
    </p>
    <p>My brother-in-law leaned forward toward Nevada. “Does it hurt?”</p>
    <p>She shook her head.</p>
    <p>It hurt. I could tell it did by the stony expression on her face. It was the patented Baylor family look that
        meant yes, it fucking hurts, there is nothing to be done, stop asking me about it. Connor recognized it too
        because his face went flat. He reached out and took her hand.</p>
    <p>“Why are we going to the hospital?” I asked. “What happened to the give-birth-at-your-house plan? I liked that
        plan.”</p>
    <p>I didn’t like hospitals. Nothing good ever happened there.</p>
    <p>“It’s a High Risk Prime/Prime pregnancy,” Nevada said.</p>
    <p>“What does that mean?”</p>
    <p>“It means the baby is using his magic.&nbsp;He’s aware,” Mom said.&nbsp;“Being born is scary.&nbsp;We don’t know
        how he will react.”</p>
    <p>“But you gave birth to us and we were fine.” We were all Primes.</p>
    <p>Mom blinked.</p>
    <p>“You almost killed Mom,” Nevada told me. “You wedged yourself in and refused to be born.”</p>
    <p>“What?”</p>
    <p>“And the doctor. They pulled you out and you choked him. It took three people to pry you free.”</p>
    <p>“You’re making this up!” I turned to Mom.</p>
    <p>She had this weird expression on her face.</p>
    <p>It was true.&nbsp;“Mom!&nbsp;You never told me!”</p>
    <p>“You never asked.&nbsp;We were very lucky you didn’t transform in-utero.”</p>
    <p>How would anyone know to ask about something like that?</p>
    <p>“The difference is, none of us were empathic,” Nevada said. “And none of us were using our magic in the womb.”
    </p>
    <p>“There is a good chance that our son is empathic,” Connor said. “He’s linked to Nevada’s feelings. Sedation is
        out of the question.&nbsp;So is the Caesarean.”</p>
    <p>“Even if they counter the pain with a spinal block and I remain completely calm,” Nevada said, “Empathic babies
        are almost always severely traumatized by a C-section.&nbsp;We don’t understand why, but we’re not going to risk
        it.”</p>
    <p>Connor was a Prime Telekinetic with slight empathic powers, which I didn’t ask too much about, because when I
        looked him up on Herald, the social network for Prime groupies and gossips, the consensus said it was some kind
        of sexual thing. I didn’t want to know sexual things my sister’s husband did. There were boundaries.</p>
    <p>Most of the time Primes married within their type of magic.&nbsp;Pyrokinetics married other pyrokinetics,
        oneiromancers married other oneiromancers and so on. Nevada’s and Connor’s talents were wildly
        different.&nbsp;Nobody could predict what their baby would be like.&nbsp;The speculation on Herald ran
        rampant.&nbsp;I’ve found over seventy threads discussing it.</p>
    <p>We knew the baby was telekinetic, because some of his powers leaked to Nevada, giving her temporary telekinetic
        abilities. According to Connor, that also meant that the baby was a Prime, and with the caliber of his parents’
        magic, he wouldn’t just be a Prime. His power would be off the charts.</p>
    <p>It was perfectly possible that Connor’s empathic talent made it over to their baby and got a boost from my
        sister’s mental abilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Which meant a Prime telekinetic with no control over his magic and
        possibly capable of leveling a building with a flick of his finger was about to be squeezed, grabbed, and
        ejected out of his warm shelter while bathing in psychic pain and anxiety from his mother. If she went into full
        blown labor in the helicopter…</p>
    <p>Oh my God.</p>
    <p>“Can this thing go any faster? Make it fly faster.”</p>
    <p>Mom’s wrapped her arm around my shoulders. “Calm down.”</p>
    <p>“You don’t understand. I don’t have enough hands to catch everyone.”</p>
    <p>“If the helicopter goes down,” Connor said, “Catch Nevada first.”</p>
    <p>Nevada turned to me.&nbsp;She was wearing that older sister expression that said, “stop freaking out, the adults
        got this.”&nbsp;It used to drive me nuts, but right now it was like a soothing cold shower on my raw nerves.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;“The contractions aren’t that strong yet. Wait. We will be there in a minute.”</p>
    <p>I shut up and willed the Cobra to fly as fast as it could.</p>
    <p class="has-text-align-center">#</p>
    <p>We landed on the hospital’s rooftop helipad. A dozen people waited for us, six in tactical gear armed with
        automatic weapons and the others in identical baby blue scrubs. Did they coordinate this? If Nevada was giving
        birth to a girl, would they have showed up in pink scrubs? Somehow, I had a problem with it, but I couldn’t
        quite put it into words, and I had bigger issues to worry about.</p>
    <p>They loaded Nevada into a wheelchair, and we all rushed in a herd into a big freight elevator. It went down and
        almost immediately stopped. The doors slid open, revealing a hospital hallway with walls painted in pale cream.
        An announcement echoed, a pre-recorded artificially calm female voice pronouncing the words with crisp
        precision.</p>
    <p>
        <em>
            “Code PPB. All non-essential personnel clear the 17<sup>th</sup>
            floor.”
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>We made a left out of the elevator and sped down the hallway toward metal doors that looked like they’d come out
        of a space station and had been used to contain violent space monsters.</p>
    <p>
        <em>
            “Code PPB. All non-essential personnel clear the 17<sup>th</sup>
            floor.”
        </em>
    </p>
    <p>Nevada exhaled.</p>
    <p>“Contractions?” Connor asked.</p>
    <p>She nodded. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>The doors slid open, we passed through, and they sealed shut behind us.&nbsp;Two of the security people peeled
        off from our group and stayed behind. I glanced over my shoulder.&nbsp;One of them keyed a code into the door
        lock.&nbsp;The lights on the door turned red. A metal bar pointing toward the ceiling I thought was just a weird
        part of the door rotated forty-five degrees and the other guard locked it in place.&nbsp;If someone tried to
        force the door apart, they would have to rip through the bar to do it.</p>
    <p>Could they have made this more dramatic?</p>
    <p>A second set of doors slid open. We passed through them, shedding another pair of guards, and the speaker’s
        robotic voice vanished, cut off in mid-word.</p>
    <p>We came to T-section, where a hallway crossed ours. The way ahead was blocked by a third door. You’ve got to be
        kidding me.</p>
    <p>Nevada looked at Connor. “Are we expecting an assault?&nbsp;Is there something you forgot to tell me?”</p>
    <p>“Standard procedure,” he said.</p>
    <p>Most of the medical personnel with us split up, moving into the side hallways.&nbsp;Only two female nurses
        remained.</p>
    <p>The doors in front of us whispered open. We went through, and this time the two security dudes stayed on the
        other side.</p>
    <p>We entered a large round room.&nbsp;The walls were a smooth pale concrete, the floor also concrete in warm tones
        of brown and beige. It looked like the inside of a bunker. The air smelled of lemon and lavender. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the middle of the round bunker-room was another room, positioned perfectly in the center, no doors, only two
        doorways.&nbsp;We rolled through one of the doorways into what looked like an ordinary hospital room. Soothing
        blue walls, weird medical equipment, most of it bolted to the floor or the walls, a space-age hospital bed, a
        big screen embedded in the wall near the ceiling opposite the bed, everything seemed almost normal for a
        high-tech hospital.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the wall to the right, another doorway offered access to the bathroom.&nbsp;No door again, only a curtain
        hanging from a rod embedded in the doorway.</p>
    <p>Nevada looked at Connor. “Why aren’t there any doors?”</p>
    <p>“Less things to fly around,” he said.</p>
    <p>Yeah, also if the doctor and nurses had to run out in a hurry, not having a door helped.</p>
    <p>The nurses moved Nevada from the chair onto the bed and started saying calm things and checking things between
        her legs.</p>
    <p>I reached for my magic. It swirled in my mind, a riot of colors. I plucked at the blue one and let it settle over
        me. The cobalt image of the Beast, huge and shaggy, crouched in my mind, waiting, staring out through my eyes. I
        inhaled. The world blossomed into a kaleidoscope of scents. Gun oil, metal, disinfectant, medicinal alcohol,
        skin cells, deodorant, perfume, soap…</p>
    <p>“There are eighteen people in the hallway around this room.” Were there cameras in this room?&nbsp;Because if
        there were, my sister deserved to know she would be on display.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Nevada looked at Connor again. “You said a medical team and a few security people. You didn’t say South by
        Southwest.”</p>
    <p>A doctor walked into the room. She was about Mom’s age, curvy, with large kind eyes, dark brown skin, and a pair
        of red-framed glasses on her nose. “Hello. I’m Dr. Maier. I’m here to help you.”</p>
    <p>There was something so reassuring about the way she spoke.</p>
    <p>“I’m a Prime laborist, which means I specialize in High Risk Prime Parturition. I’ve been doing this for twenty
        years.”</p>
    <p>“Has anyone ever died?” I asked.</p>
    <p>Mom gave me her scary stare. Well, nobody else was going to ask and it was kind of important.</p>
    <p>“Yes,” Dr. Maier said. “Out of sixty-seven P/P births I’ve lost two babies and three mothers.”</p>
    <p>I typed average mortality Prime/Prime Birth into my phone. “It says here the national death rate of P/P births is
        twenty-eight percent.”</p>
    <p>“Stop,” Mom snapped. “Or I’ll take you out of here.”</p>
    <p>“They should know.”</p>
    <p>“And trauma to the newborn occurs thirty-two percent of the time,” Nevada said. “I do know. Connor and I looked
        it up.”</p>
    <p>Oh.</p>
    <p>Nevada turned to the doctor. “Thank you for helping me.”</p>
    <p>“I know it’s scary and this is an odd place to give birth, but this is the safest way for you and the baby. This
        is not our first time. We’ve done this before. Trust us.&nbsp;We’ll take good care of you.”</p>
    <p>“Why are there so many people?” Connor asked.</p>
    <p>“We have an emergency telekinetic team standing by.”</p>
    <p>“That won’t be necessary,” Connor said. “I’ll contain it.”</p>
    <p>“The father isn’t always the best person,” Dr. Maier said.</p>
    <p>“In this case, I am the best person,” the Scourge of Mexico informed her.</p>
    <p>“Very well.” Dr. Maier picked up a remote and clicked it. Several people appeared on the screen across from the
        bed. “These are our halcyons. They’re here to keep you and the baby calm. They can’t see you; they can only feel
        your mind. And they’re telling me that you’re not letting them in.”</p>
    <p>Halcyons were psionics in reverse. While psionics incited survival emotions, like fear and anger, halcyons
        soothed and calmed.</p>
    <p>“If you let them alter your mood, it might make things easier.”</p>
    <p>“I don’t think I can,” Nevada said.</p>
    <p>She had protected her mind for years now.&nbsp;The shields on it were just too thick.</p>
    <p>“Okay,” Dr. Maier said. “Then we’ll proceed without them or the telekinetics. The only people who can see you are
        in this room. Nothing is being recorded. And if at any point you want someone to leave, tell me and they’re
        gone.”</p>
    <p>Ten minutes later we knew two things. First, Nevada was almost fully dilated, which was some sort of hell term I
        didn’t want to contemplate. Second, there would be no pain killers. Apparently, my sister had nerves of steel,
        because the contractions had been coming and she’d kept it to herself and now it was too late for an epidural.
    </p>
    <p>They inserted an IV into Nevada, put a blood pressure cuff on her arm, and put a thing on her belly to monitor
        the baby’s fetal heartbeat. My sister looked slightly lost. Nevada never looked lost.&nbsp;She always had
        everything under control, even when she didn’t.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;I came over and hugged her. “If you push too hard, and the baby shoots out like a cannon ball, I promise
        I’ll catch him.”</p>
    <p>She smiled at me, but her eyes stayed haunted.</p>
    <p>The nurses adjusted things. The doctor checked her again. And then Nevada started pushing. Mom held her hand.
        There were three pushes per contraction. She would push to a count of ten and then relax.&nbsp;Push and relax.
    </p>
    <p>This went on and on.&nbsp;At some point I decided to play on my phone.</p>
    <p>We were about two hours into it when Nevada gripped Connor’s hand and screamed, and the tv screen shattered. The
        shards shot out, froze in mid-air, and neatly deposited themselves in the plastic bin.</p>
    <p>“I’ve got you,” Connor promised her. “I’ve got you.”</p>
    <p>Doctor Maier checked Nevada.&nbsp;“And we have crowning.&nbsp;Break the bed for delivery.”</p>
    <p>The nurse helped position Nevada’s legs into the stirrups and then the bottom half of the bed slid down.&nbsp;Dr.
        Maier put on a gown and gloves and parked herself between Nevada’s legs. I didn’t want to look.</p>
    <p>The bed jerked to the side and gently slid back.</p>
    <p>Nevada growled.</p>
    <p>“Perhaps the halcyons…” one of the nurses said.</p>
    <p>“Fuck the halcyons,” my sister snarled.</p>
    <p>“You’re doing great,” Dr. Maier assured her.&nbsp;“And push.”</p>
    <p>Nevada strained and relaxed.&nbsp;The fetal monitor made a small noise.</p>
    <p>“Why is the baby’s heart rate rising?” my sister’s voice spiked.</p>
    <p>“This is normal,” Dr. Maier told her.&nbsp;“Accelerated heartbeat means a happy baby.&nbsp;The heart rate
        decelerates and accelerates during labor, but everything I’m seeing is within normal levels. Stay calm.”</p>
    <p>Another contraction gripped Nevada. The fetal contraption beeped. A medical monitor tore from the wall and
        hurtled towards me, freezing three feet from my head. It hovered there for a second then streaked into the waste
        bin.</p>
    <p>The room turned into a horror movie set. Nevada screaming, fetal monitor going haywire, things flying around,
        equipment exploding, and my brother-in-law standing in the middle of the chaos, catching things with his mind
        and holding Nevada’s right hand, while Mom held her left, and the doctor kept assuring my sister that everything
        was going as planned.</p>
    <p>I hid by the side of the bed, next to Mom. It seemed like the safest spot.</p>
    <p>It kept going and going.</p>
    <p>I snuck a peek. Sweat drenched Nevada. She was breathing like she had run a marathon. Connor’s face turned
        bloodless, and I couldn’t tell if he was exhausted or worried.</p>
    <p>Nevada’s gaze met mine.</p>
    <p>“You’re doing great,” I squeaked.</p>
    <p>Above us, the ceiling cracked.</p>
    <p>Just let it be over. Please let it be over. Please let everyone be okay.</p>
    <p>“Almost there,” the doctor crooned. “One big push. One more.”</p>
    <p>Nevada whimpered. The wall behind her shattered. The pieces hung in mid-air caught by Connor’s magic.</p>
    <p>“One more,” Dr. Maier prompted.</p>
    <p>“You keep saying one more…”</p>
    <p>Nevada’s voice was so weak. &nbsp;I’d never heard her sound like that. What if she was dying? She couldn’t be
        dying.</p>
    <p>A nurse blotted her forehead. “Almost done, sweetie.”</p>
    <p>“And.. push.”</p>
    <p>Nevada strained, moaning.</p>
    <p>“There you go,” Dr. Maier said. “And the head is out. One more time. This is the last one, I promise.”</p>
    <p>My sister screamed. A huge crack split the wall and the floor. The room shook. I shut my eyes.</p>
    <p>A baby cried. I looked up and saw him, red and wrinkled, smeared with some sort of goo. He had dark hair and he
        sounded just like a sad kitten who needed to be rescued.</p>
    <p>Suddenly things stopped moving. Nevada slumped on the bed.</p>
    <p>Connor kissed her. “You did it.”</p>
    <p>“Is he okay?” she asked.</p>
    <p>“He’s fine,” Dr. Maier told her. “A perfectly healthy boy.”</p>
    <p>I sagged against the wall. I was never, ever getting pregnant.</p>
    <p>Ever.</p>
    <p class="has-text-align-center">#</p>
    <p>The room was shrouded in comforting gloom. A table lamp in the corner glowed with a soft yellow light. Nevada was
        asleep on the bed. I saw how much blood came out of her. I still couldn’t believe she was breathing. The first
        time she dozed off, I had poked her to make sure she hadn’t died.</p>
    <p>Connor slept in a chair. I had a feeling he also thought Nevada was going to die. As soon as she fell asleep, he
        passed out.</p>
    <p>Mom had gone home. After the baby was born, Catalina came in all bloody and glassy eyed. Mom talked to Alessandro
        and something bad must have happened to my other sister, because Mom decided to take her home. Poor Mom. First,
        Nevada gave the apocalypse birth, and then Catalina shuffled in like a zombie. This was one of the rare moments
        when I was the good kid.</p>
    <p>My nephew napped in the crib next to his mom. He was all cleaned up, and now he sort of resembled a baby. On a
        scale of angel to hellspawn, yeah, I had seen cuter babies. Obviously, I didn’t say anything, but I did sort of
        ask Mom if he would look a little less alien later. She told me to give it a week.</p>
    <p>A nurse came in and reached for the baby. Connor awoke. He didn’t say anything, he just opened his eyes.</p>
    <p>“I’ll bring him right back,” the nurse said and carried him off.</p>
    <p>They had been taking the baby out for different medical things, and Connor always went with them. He looked so
        tired.</p>
    <p>I got up and told him quietly, “I’ve got this one. Rest.”</p>
    <p>He looked about to argue, but I was already moving.</p>
    <p>The nurse hurried down the hallway, two of Connor’s security guys trailing her. She ducked into a room on the
        left, and the guards turned to follow her and stopped at the doorway, with identical blank looks on their faces.
    </p>
    <p>Oh no you don’t.</p>
    <p>I sped up, pulling on the blue aspect again. Three people besides the baby and the nurse… Wait a minute.</p>
    <p>Ha!</p>
    <p>I moved silently, sliding behind the catatonic guards. An older man, an older woman, a scary guy in a suit.</p>
    <p>My evil grandmother cradled her great grandchild. The older man next to her practically glowed with pride.</p>
    <p>Well, imagine that. That certainly cleared some things up.</p>
    <p>“What a beautiful boy,” Victoria Tremaine purred. “What a lovely, lovely boy.”</p>
    <p>The older man smiled.</p>
    <p>My evil grandmother rocked the baby. “Look, Trevor, isn’t he the most beautiful child you’ve ever seen?”</p>
    <p>“Yes, ma’am. He is,” the man in the suit said.</p>
    <p>I let them have a few more minutes and walked into the room.</p>
    <p>“Grandmother, Grandfather, scary guy I don’t know, I’ll take the baby now.”</p>
    <p>Victoria narrowed her eyes at me. I held out my arms. She sighed and passed the baby to me. He squirmed and made
        a cat noise.</p>
    <p>“Support the head,” Grandmother said.</p>
    <p>“I know.”</p>
    <p>“We will not speak of this,” my grandfather said.</p>
    <p>I gave him a big smile. “That will depend entirely on you.”</p>
    <p>I walked back to the room, cradling my nephew. He was so tiny.  And kind of cute.</p>
    <p>“Don’t worry,” I told him softly, snuggling him closer. “I’m the cool aunt. I won’t let anything bad happen to
        you.</p>
    <p>The baby looked back at me with big round eyes and farted.</p>
