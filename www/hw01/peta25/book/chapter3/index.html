    </figure>


    <p>The everything drawer jammed, one-third open. Marina rattled it, trying to shake loose whatever kept it from
        sliding out. In less than thirty-six hours the entire family would converge on the house. The kitchen looked
        like a war zone, the living room was a mess, and she still hadn &#8217;t purchased the Zinfandel to marinate the
        leg of lamb. The garlic cloves had sprouted too, so she would have to pick up some.</p>
    <p>The drawer resisted shaking. Exasperated, she stepped back, crossed her arms on her chest, and glared at it.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Open!&#8221;</p>
    <p>Something snapped with a sharp wooden crack and the drawer flew open, its rollers slamming against the wooden
        frame with a shudder. A small object shot out and hit her between the eyes. &#8220;Ow!&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;What did you break?&#8221;Nikolai asked from the living room.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Nothing!&#8221;</p>
    <p>She tossed the splintered wooden spoon into the garbage can and bent to pick up the thing that hit her off the
        floor. A key. A small blue key, warm to the touch. She couldn &#8217;t recall seeing it before. How odd &#8230;
    </p>
    <p>Her brother &#8217;s voice tugged on her attention. &#8220;What are you looking for?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;A can opener.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Just open it the other way.&#8221;</p>
    <p>No time to investigate it now. Marina tossed the key back into the drawer and rummaged through its contents.
        Screwdriver, Scotch tape &#8230;In her present state of mind, opening the can &#8220;the other way &#8221;wasn
        &#8217;t a good idea, not unless she planned on cooking the pumpkin pie straight in the can. A bamboo skewer, a
        small blue key again &#8230;Her fingertips brushed the key and tingled slightly as spark of power shot into her
        skin.</p>
    <p>The phone rang. She picked it up. &#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;And how &#8217;s my favorite niece?&#8221;The sheen of warmth in Lilian &#8217;s voice was too thin to
        fool her. She had bought into it when she was a little girl. She used to love to visit Lilian, until she figured
        out that all her aunt wished to do was to show off her pretty bright niece to her friends. Like a cute dog that
        does charming tricks.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Busy!&#8221;Marina said. &#8220;How are you?&#8221;</p>
    <p>In the living room Nikolai raised his head from a page of nuclear physics equations long enough to roll his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>&#8220;I &#8217;d like you to know that I &#8217;m putting fifty dollars into the birthday account,&#8221;Lilian
        announced.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Thank you very much.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Well, we can &#8217;t do it very often, but then grandmother has a birthday only once a year and she doesn
        &#8217;t have that many of them left.&#8221;</p>
    <p>And you can &#8217;t wait. Words hovered on Marina &#8217;s lips and she bit them back. &#8220;We all appreciate
        your help very much.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Yes, well, I meant to tell you that Kostya would like Chicken Tabacca. He &#8217;s been on about it for a
        week.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Marina grimaced. &#8220;I &#8217;m making lamb this year &#8230;&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;I already promised him you &#8217;d make the chicken. You know how he loves his cousin &#8217;s
        cooking.&#8221;</p>
    <p>A beep announced an incoming call. &#8220;Would you excuse me for a moment, I have another call &#8230;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>A push of a button and grandmother &#8217;s shrill voice flooded the phone. &#8220;Marina? Are you there?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>&#8220;Yes, grandmother.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Do you want me to come over?&#8221;</p>
    <p>Lord, no. &#8220;No, I think we &#8217;re doing pretty well here. But I &#8217;ll call you if I need help.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>&#8220;You don &#8217;t have to worry about desert. I &#8217;m making Mishka cake,&#8221;grandmother announced.
    </p>
    <p>The memory of last year &#8217;s grandma-made Napoleon thrust herself before Marina and she nearly gagged.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Mishka?&#8221;she croaked. &#8220;That &#8217;s so nice. But it &#8217;s your birthday. Why don &#8217;t
        you take it easy and I &#8217;ll make the Mishka.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;No, you don &#8217;t know how to make it right.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Yeah, grandma, she doesn &#8217;t put rancid sour cream into hers!&#8221;Nikolai yelled.</p>
    <p>She hated when he amplified the sound to eavesdrop. She slapped her hand over the receiver and hissed in sharp
        whisper, &#8220;Stop it!&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Marina?&#8221;grandmother &#8217;s voice came alarmed. &#8220;Marina?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;I wish you &#8217;d rest, grandma,&#8221;she said. I have Lilian on the other line &#8230;&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;How is she?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;I &#8217;m sure she &#8217;s well. Why don &#8217;t you call her in a minute? I really have to go now,
        grandma.&#8221;</p>
    <p>She pushed the button and was greeted by the disconnect signal. Once again, Lilian had outmaneuvered her. Now she
        would have to make the chicken. And she still hadn &#8217;t found the can opener.</p>
    <p>Nikolai wandered into the kitchen and picked up the can of pumpkin mix. She felt him concentrate on the seal. A
        thin invisible tendril of force stretched between her brother &#8217;s eyes and the can like a taut fishing
        line. The can turned slowly on the tip of his finger and the seal peeled itself from its top.</p>
    <p>&#8220;She hung up on you, huh?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Now you &#8217;ll have to make the chicken.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
    <p>She took the can from him and dumped its contents into a metal bowl. Something clanked.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Why do you do this every year?&#8221;Nikolai leaned against the cabinet. &#8220;They &#8217;ll come and
        expect to be fed and want their asses kissed for contributing a measly fifty bucks so we can buy grandma a
        present she &#8217;ll complain about. Nobody ever helps you.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;You do.&#8221;She thrust the can of evaporated milk at him. He peeled off the lid and she dumped it into
        the pumpkin mix.</p>
    <p>&#8220;You know what I mean. When was the last time Lilian or Svetlana offered to wash the dishes after? Or come
        early to help set the table. We have four cousins and how many of them went to help grandma with the apples?
        None. But they all got some of the jam you made. They come, they eat, they posture, and they leave. Like
        Mongols.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;I don &#8217;t do it for them. I do it for grandmother,&#8221;she said.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Why? It &#8217;s not like she cares for us all that much.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;She loves us in her own way.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;If she loved us all that much, she &#8217;d leave us Granddad &#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>
    <p>The mention of the house never failed to irritate her. She put the key on the counter and got a carton of eggs
        out of the refrigerator. &#8220;It &#8217;s not about that house. I don &#8217;t do it for a handout. I do it
        because she is our grandmother.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;She &#8217;s shrewish and manipulative.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;She &#8217;s old and insecure, Nikolai.&#8221;Marina snapped the carton &#8217;s lid open.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Age isn &#8217;t an excuse for being an asshole.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;That was disrespectful to your grandma and to me.&#8221;</p>
    <p>He crossed his arms. &#8220;Respect has to be earned. You let everyone walk over you. They did it to Mom and now
        they do it to you.&#8221;</p>
    <p>She glared at him. Hairline cracks crisscrossed the egg tops.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Don &#8217;t you have an exam to get ready for?&#8221;</p>
    <p>He went into the living room. She picked two eggs from the carton and cracked them into a large bowl. The worst
        part was that Nikolai was right. It was about the house. She loved that house. Grandad built it from the ground
        up. They played in it as children. From spring to mid-fall, she spent most of her weekends out there maintaining
        the garden. And now Lilian, who couldn &#8217;t tell an apple tree from a walnut, was going to get it all.</p>
    <p>She had seen it coming and could do nothing about it. It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion. First,
        grandma let everyone know she was making her will. Then every time she &#8217;d visited to pick strawberries, to
        plant tomatoes, to snip extra shoots from the grape wines, grandmother would be on the phone with Lilian. In the
        end, she heard the announcement from Nonna. &#8220;Oh, by the way, have you heard? Mom &#8217;s leaving her
        house to my sister.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Then grandmother called, her voice tinny over the phone, &#8220;You &#8217;re not mad at me, are you? I take care
        of you kids for all the time.&#8221;Marina barked a short laugh, added evaporated milk to the eggs, and scraped
        the pumpkin mix into the bowl. Take care of us. Since when? The most she &#8217;d ever do was sweep the porch
        once in a while and she wanted a celebration to commemorate it. When Granddad was alive, he was the one &#8230;
    </p>
    <p>Marina took a deep breath. It wasn &#8217;t any use to get herself worked up. Yes, she could &#8217;ve sucked up
        to Grandma and gotten the house, but in the end, it wouldn &#8217;t be worth it. She plugged the mixer in and
        turned it on.</p>
    <p>Metal rang as the blades caught something. She shut the mixer off and fished in the pie mix with a spoon. The
        blue key.</p>
    <p>Marina plucked it from the mix and rinsed it. She could &#8217;ve sworn she had put it back in the drawer.
        &#8220;Now how did you get in there?&#8221;The key glistened with indigo highlights. When she was a little girl,
        she used to watch the stars, wishing for one to fall into her bedroom. That &#8217;s what it would feel like
        &#8211;warm and comforting, kind of lit from within.</p>
    <p>Later, with the pie in the oven and the sweet scent of pumpkin spice permeating the house, she went to see her
        brother. He made a show of not noticing her standing next to him.</p>
    <p>&#8220;You &#8217;re right,&#8221;she said. &#8220;I did want the house. And you &#8217;re right about the family
        &#8211;they &#8217;ll come, they &#8217;ll eat, and they &#8217;ll leave. But if I don &#8217;t do it for her,
        nobody will. And she &#8217;ll be left all alone on her birthday.&#8221;</p>
    <p>He shrugged. &#8220;I &#8217;m sorry. I shouldn &#8217;t have said &#8230;stuff.&#8221;</p>
    <p>She dismissed his apology with a wave of her hand. &#8220;Tell me about this key and we &#8217;ll call it
        even.&#8221;</p>
    <p>He balanced the key on his index finger. &#8220;Odd.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;That &#8217;s what I thought too.&#8221;</p>
    <p>He licked the edge of the key blade. &#8220;Attic,&#8221;he said.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Are you sure? Because the last time you said basement, and it turned out to be the attic. I spent two
        hours looking in the basement.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;That was a legitimate mistake,&#8221;he said. &#8220;That hook was kept in a box full of dirt. It had soil
        signature all over it.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;She took the key from his finger. &#8220;I &#8217;ve set the timer for the pie. If it buzzes,
        turn the oven off and get me. I still have a load of stuff to make, but I can &#8217;t finish until the pie is
        cooked.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;You don &#8217;t want me to take the pie out?&#8221;Little devilish sparks danced in his eyes.</p>
    <p>&#8220;No, because you &#8217;ll eat it. Promise to not touch the pie, Nikolai.&#8221;</p>
    <p>He held up his hand. &#8220;I promise.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;There is a chocolate one in the refrigerator. Promise not to touch that one also.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;I will touch, eat, or approach no pies while you &#8217;re treasure hunting.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Good.&#8221;</p>
    <p>She took herself to the narrow staircase and climbed it to the attic.</p>
    <p class="has-text-align-center">#</p>
    <p>Marina pushed the trapdoor open and hoisted herself onto the dusty boards. An odd mishmash of items surrounded
        her. A triangular window spilled sunlight on the narrow strip of the floor, the only space that had been spared
        from being filled.</p>
    <p>She sat on the floor, not caring about dust clinging to her jeans, and watched the dust bunnies dance in the
        light. She had once asked Mom about the attic. &#8220;It &#8217;s a place where you put non-essential
        things,&#8221;she had said. Now their entire history sat crammed into this attic. The first year after Mom died,
        she used to come and cry here, where Nikolai couldn &#8217;t hear her. The ache came to her now, familiar and
        merciless, like an old vicious enemy. She pushed herself from the floor, in a hurry to get busy before the pain
        could sink her teeth into her and rip open a healed-over wound.</p>
    <p>The key was too small for the dozen trunks in plain view. It had to go to something small. Like a jewelry box.
    </p>
    <p>She crawled over a large box and stumbled onto the wooden trunk which she knew held her college papers. She
        flipped open the lid and ruffled through the stack of printed paper. &#8220;The Role of Retrosynthetic Analysis
        in the Design of Heterocyclic Synthesis.&#8221;&#8220;The Role of Women in Early Plantagenet Dynasty.&#8221;Why
        do I keep those, she wondered, touching the red mark of a grade in corner. The answer came to her from the faded
        ink of half-forgotten formulas. As long as I have them, I might go back.</p>
    <p>But that would be later. After Nikolai graduates.</p>
    <p>Marina opened her hand and looked at the key. It lay in her palm like a ray of blue light. She touched it with
        the tip of her left index finger and felt the force pulse from her. A dozen white pinpoints of light appeared
        and danced in the metal, illuminating the key from the inside out. They shimmered and shifted, and finally
        aggregated in the tip of the blade.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Let &#8217;s play the game.&#8221;Marina smiled and leaned forward. The lights shifted to the left. She
        turned until they were again in the tip. Forward, right, lean over, a little more to the left &#8230;There it
        was, under a box, a thick volume bound in leather. She pulled it free and blew the dust from the cover. A small
        lock held the book closed.</p>
    <p>No title. How odd. Oh, well, there &#8217;s one way to find out what it is.</p>
    <p>She eased the key into the lock and it turned on its own. The flap of leather holding the volume closed fell
        aside; the pages rustled like birds locked in a cage, fighting to get out. Gently she opened the cover and
        gasped as familiar warmth cloaked her. Old power swirled from the pages, comforting and overwhelming her, and
        breathless, she sat in its whirlpool. A photograph graced the first page &#8211;a man larger than life, grey
        hair stark in contrast to black bushy eyebrows, shoulders spread wide. So much looked at her from that
        photograph &#8211;strength, and pride, and kindness. Her eyes filled with tears. &#8220;Grandpa,&#8221;she
        whispered softly.</p>
    <p>The image smiled back at her. &#8220;Hi, sweetheart. I miss you.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;I miss you too.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Don &#8217;t cry, sweetie. There is no need.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;How are you?&#8221;she asked, trying to hold back the tears, but they streamed, hot against her cheek.
        &#8220;How is it wherever you are?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;No place is good without the two of you,&#8221;he said. &#8220;But don &#8217;t be in a hurry to join
        me.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;It &#8217;s grandma &#8217;s birthday,&#8221;she murmured, not sure what to say.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Are you making lamb for her?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221;he said. &#8220;How is she holding up?</p>
    <p>She tried to lie through the tears and couldn &#8217;t. &#8220;Not so well. She is forgetful and &#8230;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>&#8220;Difficult?&#8221;he guessed.</p>
    <p>She nodded wordlessly.</p>
    <p>&#8220;She always was,&#8221;Grandfather said. &#8220;Proud and strong too, like a wolf. It hurt her to admit she
        needed anybody.&#8221;</p>
    <p>The pages turned. &#8220;Look here,&#8221;he said. A large photograph occupied the page. Two people laughing. A
        woman with hair like honey streaming down her back. Hot eyes on a lovely face. A man next to her, skin tanned to
        bronze, arm wrapped around her shoulders, not possessive but guarding gently. And above them a griffin diving
        off a head-dizzying cliff, a streak of gold against the red mountain. It drew her like a magnet &#8211;so much
        might focused into a single plunge. Marina touched the golden feathers and felt the speed, the wind tearing at
        the wings, the ground rushing at her with terrifying velocity. And her heart sang with an unbelievable thrill.
    </p>
    <p>&#8220;Burgundy Cliffs,&#8221;she guessed.</p>
    <p>&#8220;She loved the griffins,&#8221;he said. &#8220;Just like you.&#8221;</p>
    <p>She sat back stunned.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Do you remember when I used to take you there?&#8221;he said. &#8220;You were so little.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Yes, I remember.&#8221;How could she forget? The power her family had welded was a part of their life, as
        routine as driving a car or baking a pie. But the griffins falling from the mountain like a golden waterfall,
        falling so fast, committed so totally to their plunge only to sweep along the ground and soar above it all
        &#8211;that was magic.</p>
    <p>He sighed. &#8220;She always wanted to go, but there was never enough money for the three of us. There wasn
        &#8217;t even enough for the two of us without my railroad dispatcher discount and that covered only me.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>She nodded, wordless, guessing what he would say.</p>
    <p>His voice was soft. &#8220;She stayed behind so you could go.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;I never knew &#8230;&#8221;she whispered.</p>
    <p>&#8220;She didn &#8217;t want you to know. She always thought that doing favors bred contempt and she didn
        &#8217;t want you feel indebted and learn to resent her. She loves you so much.&#8221;</p>
    <p>She bit her lip.</p>
    <p>&#8220;You don &#8217;t resent her, do you, sweetheart?&#8221;he asked.</p>
    <p>&#8220;No, grandfather. Not at all.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Marina!&#8221;Nikolai &#8217;s voice came from the kitchen. &#8220;The pie is done!&#8221;</p>
    <p>She looked one more time at the couple in the photograph. &#8220;You were so young,&#8221;she whispered.</p>
    <p>&#8220;One can &#8217;t stay young forever. But my namesake is calling you.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;I better go,&#8221;she said, wondering if her heart would break.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Come see me any time,&#8221;he said. &#8220;I will be waiting.&#8221;</p>
    <p>She closed the book gently.</p>
    <p class="has-text-align-center">#</p>
    <p>She told Nikolai that night over the evening coffee and salami sandwiches.</p>
    <p>&#8220;There is just enough money in the birthday account.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;They &#8217;ll skin you alive,&#8221;he said.</p>
    <p>&#8220;That &#8217;s all right,&#8221;she said. &#8220;It will be worth it. I must do this.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
    <p>She shook her head, thinking of the young woman with honey hair and of the griffins perched upon the jagged
        cliffs. &#8220;For both of us, for me and her. It &#8217;s not something I can explain. You have to find out for
        yourself.&#8221;</p>
    <p class="has-text-align-center">#</p>
    <p>In the morning she met them on the porch. They came at the same time, as if afraid to arrive too early. She
        watched as they parked their cars and approached the porch, her aunts, uncles, cousins. It struck her how put
        out they looked, as if distressed to be here.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Are we early?&#8221;Lilian asked.</p>
    <p>&#8220;No. There will be no party today, but you &#8217;re welcome to the dinner. It &#8217;s a modest
        one.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Where is mother?&#8221;Nonna asked, her eyes searching the yard.</p>
    <p>&#8220;She is enjoying her birthday present,&#8221;Marina said, crossed her arms on her chest, and smiled.</p>
    <p>They declined to stay for dinner.</p>
    <p>Marina saw them go and sat down on the porch with a cup of hot cider in her hand. Above her the sky was gold with
        sunlight. She looked at it and thought of golden griffins. No wonder Nikolai didn &#8217;t understand. He never
        saw them. He never felt the freedom they brought, but she had, and the memory lived in her, its beauty so sharp
        it hurt. It sliced through the fog of time, clear as a crystal shard, and no matter what life brought, that
        memory was hers to cherish. A gift beyond measure. Marina smiled and sipped the cider. Funny how people you
        think you know can surprise you.</p>
    <p class="has-text-align-center">#</p>
    <p>Miles away, Nikolai helped his grandmother step off the train.</p>
    <p>&#8220;We will miss the party,&#8221;she said. &#8220;Why did you drag me here? Where are we anyhow?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Just come with me, Grandma.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;I think we should go back.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;All right, we &#8217;ll go. In just a minute. First I want to show you something.&#8221;</p>
    <p>He led her past the station house to the stone trail. They walked along the curving path, guarded by a metal
        rail.</p>
    <p>&#8220;You made me come all the way out here just to show me something? The tickets must &#8217;ve cost a
        fortune. All that money wast &#8230;&#8221;</p>
    <p>The path turned and she fell silent. A great gorge lay before them, a crack in Earth &#8217;s armor. A silver
        river wound its way along the bottom like a glittering serpent. Red cliffs cradled the water, scraping the sky
        with their edges.</p>
    <p>Gently he led her onto the tall bridge that sliced across the gorge and found a good spot at the rail. Wind
        rushed through the chasm and fanned their faces, and they breathed in the moisture of the river and the heady
        honey scent of melaleuca that sheathed the valley lapping at the cliffs &#8217;feet. So ethereal and
        insignificant was the bridge compared to the colossal vista before them, that it was as if it didn &#8217;t even
        exist and they stood suspended in mid-air.</p>
    <p>High atop a red cliff, a golden griffin spread its wings and cried out a hoarse greeting. Nikolai heard her gasp
        and gently put his arm around his grandmother. The majestic beast teetered on the edge and took the plunge like
        a living flame. It dived and turned at the last moment, defying gravity with its mighty wings, sliding along the
        ground and then surging up and up to soar, free and unbound. And Nikolai understood and held his grandmother
        closer.</p>
    <p>Others followed the first, wings spread wide, amber eyes hot with magic. The old woman leaned against her
        grandson and watched as the mountains wept golden tears to match her own.</p>

        <figcaption>A rider on the back of a great white dragon</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <p>The sun rolled toward the horizon, painting the sky red and gold.&nbsp;The layers of mountains faded into dying
        light, each more faint than the last, until the furthest of the peaks seemed little more than ghosts.&nbsp;If
        Raina was home, she would’ve watched it for a while from the remnants of the castle wall, but now time was
        short.&nbsp;They were losing the light.</p>
    <p>“Round, Puffles. Let’s scare them one more time.”</p>
    <p>The aging dragon banked.&nbsp;Wind buffeted her face, pulling her wide-brimmed hat. She shifted her weight to
        stay in the saddle. Puffles turned and streaked above the green pasture.&nbsp;His shadow fell on the three
        sacrificial sheep in a small corral, and the ewes bleated in alarm.</p>
    <p>Where were they?&nbsp;Here she had three delicious sheep crying their hearts out, and the pack was nowhere in
        sight.</p>
    <p>The eerie howl soared to the sky, a vicious gleeful song of a predator catching the scent of its prey.&nbsp;Raina
        turned in the saddle.&nbsp;The howl had come from the east.&nbsp;She had expected the pack from the west.</p>
    <p>Puffles raised his massive head.&nbsp;A puff of dark smoke broke free of his fangs.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“Yes, I heard that too. Easy.&nbsp;They’re not here yet.”</p>
    <p>Another howl cut the silence, shorter and sharper than the first.&nbsp;The small hairs on the back of her neck
        rose. &nbsp;They’d found their victim and were closing in, and that victim was nowhere near her sheep.&nbsp;Damn
        it.</p>
    <p>Raina leaned in the saddle. “Forward.”</p>
    <p>The dragon beat his wings, surging through the air.&nbsp;The pasture jerked back, out of sight.&nbsp;Woods rolled
        under them.</p>
    <p>“Faster, Puffles.&nbsp;Faster.”</p>
    <p>The narrow strip of woods ended.&nbsp;A light ribbon of the road snaked its way north with a hundred yards of
        clear ground followed by woods on each side.&nbsp;A lone traveler in a grey cloak stood on the road, brandishing
        a long stick.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“Hold!”</p>
    <p>The dragon’s wings snapped up, and he rode the updraft, hanging in midair.</p>
    <p>Five dark shapes broke free of the copse of trees across the road and charged toward the traveler.&nbsp;The
        master shepherd was right.&nbsp;Wargs.&nbsp;The big shaggy hounds of Alsace had no trouble holding off the
        regular wolves and mountain lions, but wargs topped two hundred pounds each. They could shear through a sheep’s
        spine in one bite and carry off a three-hundred-pound ram like he weighed nothing. A regular wolf pack took one
        sheep and ate it for a week.&nbsp;When wargs came, they took one every night and they killed any hound or human
        who tried to stop them.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The man swung his cane, warming up.</p>
    <p>The wargs sprinted to him.&nbsp;Nice tight group.&nbsp;They’d rip him apart.</p>
    <p>Puffles was still hanging.&nbsp;His eyesight wasn’t what it once was.&nbsp;He couldn’t see them in twilight. She
        would have to be his eyes.</p>
    <p>Raina released the reins and leaned forward, tucking herself flat against the dragon’s back. “Dive!”</p>
    <p>The drake dipped his head, beat his wings once, and pressed them against his sides. The ground rushed at her with
        heart-stopping speed. The wind turned into a solid force trying to rip her free.&nbsp;A cold flash of fear and
        exhilaration burst in her, and she drank it in until the ground yawned, too close.&nbsp;Raina tugged the reins.
    </p>
    <p>The drake’s wings snapped open.&nbsp;They leveled and zoomed over the man on the road at a breakneck speed, so
        close, the dragon’s claws could’ve locked on his shoulders. The pack was right in front of them. Puffles still
        didn’t see them.</p>
    <p>“Warg!” she screamed into the wind. “Warg, Puffles, warg!”</p>
    <p>A loud rumble began deep in the dragon’s belly.&nbsp;The terrifying jaws unhinged, and a gout of flame tore
        out.&nbsp;The three leading wargs vanished in a ball of white fire.&nbsp;The other two veered left, but it was
        too late. Puffles had seen them.&nbsp;He banked sharply to the left, following.&nbsp;They sprinted across the
        grass, but no animal on four legs could outrun a flying dragon. Another burst of fire caught the closest
        warg.&nbsp;The last beast dashed right in a desperate attempt to escape, but the drake claws caught
        him.&nbsp;The warg yelped. The great scythe talons squeezed, cutting off the sound in mid-cry.</p>
    <p>Puffles beat his wings, gaining height, and settled into a wide circle.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“Best dragon ever.”&nbsp;She leaned forward and petted his muscular, scaly neck.&nbsp;“They didn’t stand a
        chance.”</p>
    <p>Puffles coughed, little streaks of smoke escaping his mouth.&nbsp;It sounded like chuckling. He was quite pleased
        with himself and he wanted her to know it.</p>
    <p>“So mighty.&nbsp;And fast.&nbsp;And brave.”</p>
    <p>Puffles hurled the warg’s body into the air and dropped twenty feet down.&nbsp;Raina’s stomach made a valiant
        effort to jump out of her body.&nbsp;The warg plummeted in front of them and Puffles snatched it in
        mid-air.&nbsp;Raina swallowed, trying to catch her breath.</p>
    <p>“That’s a fine warg.&nbsp;The biggest warg I’ve ever seen.&nbsp;You’re such a good hunter.”</p>
    <p>Puffles chuckled.</p>
    <p>“You know what’s bothering me?”&nbsp;She looked down where the man in the grey cloak watched her from
        below.&nbsp;“Why didn’t he run for the woods?&nbsp;Who sees five wargs coming at him and thinks, ‘I’ll just stay
        here and wave my stick!’ instead of climbing the nearest tree?”</p>
    <p>Small puffs of smoke escaped between Puffle’s fangs.</p>
    <p>“Yes, I know you wouldn’t run, but you’re a mighty dragon.&nbsp;He’s a puny human, and I haven’t seen him before.
        Why don’t we go down there and ask him who he is and what he’s doing three miles from our keep? Land, please.”
    </p>
    <p>Puffles glided down in a slow arc.&nbsp;The great paws touched the ground.&nbsp;He ran for four steps, spread his
        wings, and trotted over to the man.&nbsp;Raina stayed in the saddle.</p>
    <p>Most people confronted with a dragon rider on a Gallian Drake the size of Puffles reacted as if they were backed
        into a corner by a rabid dog.&nbsp;They watched him like a hawk and kept their movements small and slow. The man
        showed no tension.&nbsp;He leaned on his stick, which turned out to be a cane, his pose relaxed, the line of his
        shoulders easy.&nbsp;Either he had no sense at all, or he had a good reason to not be afraid.</p>
    <p>Raina scrutinized him as Puffles trotted closer.&nbsp;The traveler was tall and lean, most of him hidden by a
        well-worn grey cloak.&nbsp;Nobody had even tried to patch the tattered hem or the burn on the left
        thigh.&nbsp;Tall leather boots, but no hat.&nbsp;He’d tied his grey hair at the back of his neck, and the wind
        was doing its best to throw the long white strands at his face.</p>
    <p>It was a weathered face of a man in his sixties, creased by wrinkles, with a short beard and moustache. An old
        scar climbed up his left cheek up and disappeared into his hairline. He was smiling, but his eyes under the
        thick eyebrows watched her with the calm focus of a predator.&nbsp;Sharp and dark, they missed nothing.&nbsp;She
        was wrong.&nbsp;There were six wargs on this road, not five, one of them human.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>She smiled back and tried to look not too bright.&nbsp;“Hello there.”</p>
    <p>“That was some fancy flying,” the traveler said.&nbsp;“Much obliged.”</p>
    <p>A light, crisp accent, the same one she’d heard from her mother every day.&nbsp;A man from the
        capital.&nbsp;Alsace was as far away from Bellesere as you could get and still remain in Gallia.&nbsp;She petted
        Puffles’s scaly neck.&nbsp;Mother always said that nothing good ever came out of the capital.</p>
    <p>“Are you hurt?” she asked.</p>
    <p>He raised his arms to the sides.&nbsp;“Completely unharmed.&nbsp;Thank you.”</p>
    <p>“You’re welcome.&nbsp;We do what we can to keep the roads safe.&nbsp;We don’t get many visitors this
        way.”&nbsp;Unless they were wool merchants.</p>
    <p>He smiled again, his eyes narrowing to mere slits.&nbsp;“Is that your subtle way of asking me where I’m headed?”
    </p>
    <p>“Goodness, no. But if you’re lost, I can point the way.”</p>
    <p>“I’m looking for a man,” the traveler said. “Maybe you know him.&nbsp;His name is Felin Belfort.&nbsp;He’s
        supposed to live somewhere around here. You remind me of him.”</p>
    <p>He knew her father. “Do we look alike?”</p>
    <p>“No.&nbsp;You fly alike.”</p>
    <p>He knew her father during the war, and he came to find him.&nbsp;The question was, should she take this old warg
        in human skin home?&nbsp;He didn’t seem like a soldier.&nbsp;The bearing was wrong.&nbsp;She’d met veterans
        before.&nbsp;They looked you straight in the eye and they held themselves like they had nothing to prove. He
        felt more like her mother.&nbsp;A killer.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>He probably knew exactly where Belfort Keep was, and if he kept going down this road, he would find it.&nbsp;If
        he somehow got lost along the way, any passerby would point out the way.&nbsp;She could take him home now, when
        father and Mother would be both there, getting ready to eat dinner, or she could fly ahead and announce that she
        met him.&nbsp;The second way meant risking him showing up at a time of his choosing.</p>
    <p>No, better to bring him now.&nbsp;Three, three and a half, if she counted her brother, against one were good
        odds.</p>
    <p>“What a coincidence.&nbsp;Felin Belfort is my father.”</p>
    <p>Something moved in the deep shadows under the tree on the other side of the cleared ground.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“The Keep is just past that hill.”</p>
    <p>She felt the weight of someone’s gaze.&nbsp;Too early in the season for Seaxonian bandits and they would think
        twice about taking on the drake. An urge to take to the air gripped her. She crushed it and kept talking.</p>
    <p>“I’ll show you the way.”</p>
    <p>“Much obliged,” the man said again.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“Do you have a mount?”</p>
    <p>The traveler gave a short, sharp whistle.&nbsp;A mare trotted out from under the trees, from the spot where the
        darkness watched her and clopped her way to them.</p>
    <p>Whatever hid in the shadows was still there.&nbsp;Watching.&nbsp;Waiting.</p>
    <p>The man swung into the saddle.&nbsp;Raina touched Puffles’ neck and shifted her weight, urging him
        forward.&nbsp;They rode side by side, she on the dragon and the traveler on his horse.&nbsp;The spot between her
        shoulder blades itched. She pictured an arrow slicing out of the shadows and piercing her back.</p>
    <p>“You never told me your name,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Jehan.”</p>
    <p>Just Jehan.&nbsp;No last name, no title.&nbsp;The name told her nothing.</p>
    <p>“Raina Belfort.”</p>
    <p>“Lovely name.”</p>
    <p>“Thank you.”</p>
    <p>“That’s an old fellow you have there,” Jehan said.&nbsp;“Is he going to be alright walking?”</p>
    <p>“It’s good for him to stretch the joints a little.”</p>
    <p>Puffles shifted the warg in his mouth.&nbsp;When he was younger, he was a fine example of a brown Gallian Drake.
        He was vicious and fast, the pride of the royal dragon stables.&nbsp;He fought against the Anglian shrikes, the
        Seaxonian adlers, and the colossal monster dragons of the Jutes and survived.&nbsp;Through it all, he carried
        her father on his back.&nbsp;He was no longer that fast, but he was still vicious.</p>
    <p>“What’s his name?” Jehan asked.</p>
    <p>“Garan the Proud.”</p>
    <p>“He’s in his sixties, I take it?”</p>
    <p>“Seventies.”</p>
    <p>“Not many people would keep a dragon of this age.&nbsp;The upkeep must cost a fortune.”</p>
    <p>He was probing for information.&nbsp;She would have to be careful.&nbsp;Raina patted the dragon’s neck again,
        feeling the rough edges of the scales under her fingertips.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“No matter how old he gets, he’ll always have a roost and a good meal at our house, because he brought my father
        home.”</p>
    <p>Jehan nodded.&nbsp;“Felin always pays his debts.”&nbsp;</p>
    <p>And what did her father owe him? A feeling of dread came over her, as she was watching an incoming storm brewing
        on the horizon and could do nothing to stop it.</p>
    <p>“Must be a quiet life here in the Provinces,” Jehan said.</p>
    <p>“Well, the wargs come at the end of winter, the Seaxonian bandits raid in the early summer, and the wild drakes
        fly down from the mountains in the fall, during the mating season, and during winter when the food is
        scarce.&nbsp;Other than that it’s pretty quiet.”&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“Everything but the Jutes.”</p>
    <p>“That’s right.”&nbsp;Alsace lay too far from the coast, away from the Jute raiding routes.&nbsp;The last time the
        northerners invaded the province happened over three decades ago and only because Gallian army had driven them
        inland.</p>
    <p>“I’d imagine not much to do for a woman of your age.”</p>
    <p>“I keep busy.”&nbsp;Odd topic of conversation.</p>
    <p>“There are two types of young people in places like these.&nbsp;Those who are affianced and ready to start a
        family by eighteen summers and those who can’t wait to get out.”</p>
    <p>Three days ago, when she’d come home from chasing off a young wild drake who’d been taking too much interest in
        the herd in the northern pasture, Father had asked her if she wanted to marry Dizier Sirrel, because his father
        had proposed a match.&nbsp;It took her a full minute and two gulps of wine to overcome the coughing.&nbsp;She
        told them that Dizier was mean to dogs and very proud that his parents were first cousins who married for the
        purity of his bloodline. Mother laughed about it for half of the evening.</p>
    <p>“I’m not affianced.”&nbsp;She smiled at him.&nbsp;“But I’m happy here.”</p>
    <p>“That makes things easier,” Jehan said.</p>
    <p>She didn’t see how.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>They cleared the hill.&nbsp;Beyond it, the ground gently sloped only to rise again, with the keep perched on the
        apex of next hill.&nbsp;The sunset had burned down to dim coals, and in its weak reddish light, Belfort’s white
        walls almost glowed against the greenery.&nbsp;The old castle sat atop a hill like a broken crown, part of its
        once tall wall missing.&nbsp;Thirty-six years passed since the Jute attack, but the black scorching marks of
        dragon fire still stained the walls, permanently embedded in the stone.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Raina fought a shiver.&nbsp;When she was a little girl, the survivors would tell her stories of that night, dark
        scary fairy tales of fire, monsters, and northern barbarians. It took only one blast from the giant Jute dragon
        to rip through the solid stone and set everything inside ablaze.&nbsp;The fire had been so intense that the wall
        had glowed red for hours.</p>
    <p>Their family had since rebuilt the inner keep, with dragon and horse stables, but the ruined wall had been a much
        lower priority. At its lowest, it stood tall enough to stop a man and a warg, and that was good enough for now.
    </p>
    <p>“Lovely place,” Jehan said.&nbsp;“Do you think your mother will be home?”</p>
    <p>She was counting on it. “We’ll just have to see.&nbsp;I’ll go ahead by air and open the gate for you.”</p>
    <p>“Can’t wait,” he said and smiled.</p>
    <p class="has-text-align-center">#</p>
    <p>Puffles landed in the courtyard on the landing pad in front of the stables.&nbsp;Raina dismounted and opened the
        heavy steel gates of the dragon roost.&nbsp;Jehan would be here any minute.&nbsp;She had to secure the
        dragons.&nbsp;If things got ugly, dragon fire everywhere was the last thing they’d need.&nbsp;And things would
        get ugly.&nbsp;She was sure of it.</p>
    <p>Puffles pranced past her inside, stopped by Korvan’s roost and waved the warg in the younger dragon’s
        direction.&nbsp;Like Puffles, Korvan was a Gallian drake, but where the older dragon was dark brown, almost
        black, Korvan’s hide was the color of whiskey, and when the light shone through his great leathery wings, they
        looked almost amber.</p>
    <p>Puffles shook the warg, showing off. Korvan got up and shifted back and forth on his massive feet, whining.</p>
    <p>“Stop teasing him.”</p>
    <p>Puffles gave the warg one last shake, walked into his roost on the bed of soft white sand, dropped his prize onto
        the stone platform in the corner, and began to feed. Raina closed the metal gate, took a deep breath, and went
        to the front gate.</p>
    <p>Jehan was waiting when she opened the gates.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“The stable is to your left.”</p>
    <p>“Thank you.”&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The mare clopped by her.</p>
    <p>The sunset had burned down to coals, and long purple shadows claimed the countryside, stretching from the woods
        to lick at the white walls of Belfort.&nbsp;Raina peered at the darkness.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Nothing.</p>
    <p>No odd sounds, no stray shapes sliding soundlessly in the twilight, no eerie feeling of being watched.&nbsp;So
        why was she still uneasy?</p>
    <p>She shut the door and barred it.&nbsp;Jehan had put up his horse and was waiting for her by the stable
        gates.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“This way.”&nbsp;She led him to the main building of the keep, grasped the handle of the heavy metal door, and
        opened it.&nbsp;“Please.&nbsp;First doorway on the left.”</p>
    <p>He smiled.&nbsp;“After you.”</p>
    <p>Go first and give him the opportunity to stab her in the back? “No, I insist.”</p>
    <p>Cold brushed her cheek, like the soft brush of a feather someone had chilled in the ice cellar.&nbsp;The tiny
        hairs on the back of her neck rose.&nbsp;The darkness had followed them home, and now it slipped inside the
        keep.</p>
    <p>“If you insist.”&nbsp;Jehan strode into the building.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>She pulled her hunting knife out and hid in her hand.&nbsp;Ahead Jehan turned through the</p>
    <p>“I’m home, and I brought a visitor!” she called out.&nbsp;“From the capital!”</p>
    <p>Jehan walked into the great hall.&nbsp;She was only a step behind.</p>
    <p>An old wooden table, a scarred veteran of many culinary battles, occupied the center of the room. &nbsp;Massive
        and solid, it could sit twenty-four comfortably, but most days only four seats were occupied. Father sat on the
        far left, Mother across from him, Raul next to Father, and she would normally sit down next to Mother.</p>
    <p>Her parents looked up.&nbsp;Father, tall, broad-shouldered, still athletic in his early fifties, dark hair worn
        short, left over from his days as a Guard.&nbsp;Her mother was his exact opposite. Short, curvy, with a
        waterfall of blonde hair, and big blue eyes, she was beautiful and charming, and she wielded beauty and charm
        like two daggers.</p>
    <p>“Surprise!” Jehan said.</p>
    <p>Father froze with a fork in his hand.</p>
    <p>Smile died on Mother’s lips.&nbsp;Something vicious flared in her eyes.&nbsp;She flipped the knife in her
        hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>And that went exactly as expected.</p>
    <p>“You!” Mother hissed.</p>
    <p>“Hello, Estelle,” Jehan said.&nbsp;“I’ve come to collect.”</p>
    <p>Mother lunged forward, the knife in her hand.&nbsp;Jehan raised his stick.</p>
    <p>A shadow stretched from the wall, as if liquid, heading for her mother. Raina lunged forward, knife out. The
        blade met solid flesh.&nbsp;A thin drop of crimson wet the polished steel.</p>
    <p>The shadow fell apart, torn from the inside.&nbsp;A man glared at her.&nbsp;He wore black and her knife had
        caught him across his throat.</p>
    <p>It was suddenly very quiet.&nbsp;Mother halted in mid-step.</p>
    <p>“Well,” Jehan said.&nbsp;“She’s your daughter, Estelle.”</p>
    <p>The man stared at her.&nbsp;She looked into his eyes.&nbsp;Like two chips of ice from a glacier.&nbsp;He would
        kill her, she realized.&nbsp;He would murder everyone in the room, including her twelve-year old brother, then
        he would help himself to their dinner and wine.&nbsp;He would eat well, he would sleep untroubled, and he would
        go on with his life, never worrying about what he’d done. Her life and her family’s lives meant nothing. He
        would snuff them out as if they never existed.</p>
    <p>“Raina.” Father’s voice cracked with command. “Lower your knife and step away from our guest.”</p>
    <p>She had to kill him now, because he would never forget that she held a knife to his throat.</p>
    <p>“Raina,” Father said.</p>
    <p>His ice eyes were calm.&nbsp;He was confident he would survive. If she sliced his neck, chances are she wouldn’t
        kill him.&nbsp;If she moved, he could disappear into the shadows and then there would be no stopping the
        violence that would come next.</p>
    <p>She couldn’t cut his throat anyway, she realized.&nbsp;In the moment when he moved toward her mother, maybe, but
        not now, with him standing there glaring at her as if she’d stepped on his foot.</p>
    <p>Raina lowered the knife and took a step back.</p>
    <p>“Why don’t we all sit down and discuss this like civilized people,” Father said.&nbsp;It didn’t sound like a
        question.&nbsp;It sounded like command.&nbsp;He walked over to her mother and offered her his hand.&nbsp;Mother
        rested her fingers in his.&nbsp;Father led her to her chair and held it out for her.</p>
    <p>Raina pulled out the nearest chair and sat, two seats down from her mother.</p>
    <p>Jehan smiled and sat two chairs two her right.&nbsp;The shadow man rested his hand on the table, leapt over it,
        and sat into a chair directly across from her.&nbsp;The narrow gash on his neck dripped crimson. &nbsp;He picked
        up a linen napkin from the basket and drew it across his throat.&nbsp;It came away crimson, but the gash was
        already sealing.&nbsp;She’d barely nicked him.</p>
    <p>“Raul,” Father said.&nbsp;“Bring two extra settings.”</p>
    <p>Her brother took off for the kitchen.</p>
    <p>“Raina, pass the platter to our guests,” Mother said, loading it with so much venom, Raina almost winced.</p>
    <p>She rose, picked up the platter of chicken, and another with steamed vegetables.&nbsp;Normally the dinner would
        make her mouth water.&nbsp;Roasted chicken instead of the usual slice of smoked ham, a bottle of wine, freshly
        baked bread, a platter of cheese, steamed artichokes, and blackened asparagus.&nbsp;Raul returned with extra
        plates, forks, knives, and two wine glasses.&nbsp;She made sure to pass the platters to her left.&nbsp;Jehan
        filled his plate, and passed them to the shadow man, who picked out a drumstick and a slice of bread, and passed
        the rest to Raul.</p>
    <p>She realized she hadn’t even put anything on her plate, so she rose, got some food, and sat back down.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For a few moments, nobody spoke. Jehan sampled the wine and raised his eyebrows.&nbsp;“Not bad, Felin. Yours?”
    </p>
    <p>“Of course,” Father said, his voice calm.&nbsp;“We’re in Alsace.&nbsp;We raise sheep and make wine.”</p>
    <p>Cold pinched her spine with sharp claws. She looked up.&nbsp;The shadow man studied her with his ice
        eyes.&nbsp;She raised her chin and studied him back. &nbsp;Broad-shouldered, tall, short blond hair,
        clean-shaven.&nbsp;The black clothes hid everything except his neck and face.&nbsp;She was reasonably sure he
        was older than her, but it was impossible to tell by how much.&nbsp;He had one of those faces that would likely
        look the same at twenty-five or forty. He could’ve been Gallian, Anglican, or Seaxonian.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“You took on an apprentice,” Mother said.&nbsp;“I thought you swore it off.”</p>
    <p>“I did.”&nbsp;Jehan helped himself to the chicken.</p>
    <p>Raina put her fork down. It hurt her to watch him eat their food.</p>
    <p>“I couldn’t help it,” he continued.</p>
    <p>Mother raised her eyebrows.</p>
    <p>“The little bastard stole from me,” Jehan said.</p>
    <p>The “little bastard” ignored the conversation, tore a chunk of bread, and put it in his mouth.</p>
    <p>
        <em>Choke on it</em>
        , Raina willed.
    </p>
    <p>“You mean, you let him steal from you,” Mother said.</p>
    <p>“No, I meant I walked through the Twins Row, and when I came home, the amber crest wasn’t in my pocket.”</p>
    <p>Mother stopped eating.</p>
    <p>“I realized that he must be new, young, or dumb.”</p>
    <p>“Why?” Raul asked.</p>
    <p>“Because all of the regular pickpockets know not to steal from me.”</p>
    <p>“Because you’ll kill them?” Raul guessed.</p>
    <p>“No.&nbsp;Because I’ll cut out their eyes.” Jehan took another pull of his wine.&nbsp;“A corpse is
        forgettable.&nbsp;A man with two black holes where his eyes used to be begging on the street corner is a living
        reminder of lines one doesn’t cross.”</p>
    <p>Father put down his fork.&nbsp;“Why are you here?”</p>
    <p>Jehan reached into his cloak, withdrew a leather tube, and tossed it across the table.&nbsp;Father snapped it out
        of the air, gripped the tube, and twisted, snapping the red wax seal.&nbsp;It fell and dangled off the tube on a
        silken cord.&nbsp;A stylized Gallian drake holding an iris in its claws.&nbsp;The royal seal. &nbsp;Alarm
        squirmed through Raina.</p>
    <p>Father pulled the top off, exposing a piece of paper rolled into a tube.&nbsp;He plucked the paper out, unrolled
        it, and read it.&nbsp;Mother leaned in to read with him.</p>
    <p>Father put the paper down.&nbsp;“No.”</p>
    <p>“It’s not a request,” Jehan said.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“Over my dead body,” Mother said.</p>
    <p>“If necessary.”&nbsp;Jehan leaned back.&nbsp;“The Crown is in danger.&nbsp;He needs someone now.&nbsp;We’re all
        adults here. You knew the bargain you made.”</p>
    <p>“I’ll go,” Father said.&nbsp;“The Guard always needs instructors.”</p>
    <p>“No.”&nbsp;Jehan’s eyes turned hard.&nbsp;“He needs someone from the outside, without any ties or past loyalties
        to muddy up the waters.&nbsp;I saw her fly today.&nbsp;She executed a precision dive on a half-blind
        dragon.&nbsp;She’ll do.”</p>
    <p>It was about her.</p>
    <p>“No,” Father said.</p>
    <p>“May I see the scroll?” she asked.</p>
    <p>“No,” Father said.</p>
    <p>“I’ve reached majority,” Raina said.&nbsp;“If the scroll concerns me, I have the right to see it.”</p>
    <p>Mother took the scroll off the table and passed it to her.</p>
    <p>
        <em>Charles, by the grace of God, King of Gallia…</em>
        titles, titles, more titles &nbsp;…<em>in accordance with an oath sworn by His Father, Lothair the Stalwart, and
            as a reward for the meritorious service of Felin Belfort in Our Time of Need</em>
        … …<em>calls upon Raina Belfort to join the ranks of the Royal Dragon Guard for the good of God, King, and
            Country &#8230;&nbsp;</em>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;No.</p>
    <p>
        <em>…calls upon Raina Belfort to join the ranks of the Royal Dragon Guard for the good of God, King, and Country
            &#8230;&nbsp;</em>
    </p>
    <p>She read it again.&nbsp;It still said what it said.</p>
    <p>“Can women even join the Guard?” she asked.</p>
    <p>“They can,” Father said, staring at Jehan.&nbsp;“The Guard was started by a woman. They’re discouraged from it,
        however.”</p>
    <p>“Why?” Raul asked.</p>
    <p>“Because any time there is a dragon threat, the Guard is the first to defend and the first to die,” Mother
        said.&nbsp;“You’re not taking our daughter.”</p>
    <p>The Royal Dragon Guard served as His Majesty’s personal guards, and when he flew his dragon, they rode beside him
        into battle.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Raina looked at the scroll again.&nbsp;<em>For the period of fifteen years… </em>
        Fifteen years.&nbsp;It seemed like an eternity.&nbsp;She would be thirty five if she survived.&nbsp;Almost
        middle-aged.
    </p>
    <p>“Why don’t we ask her?” Jehan asked.</p>
    <p>“It’s not up to her,” Father snapped.&nbsp;“She’s my daughter.&nbsp;She isn’t some pickpocket you plucked from
        the street and turned into a killer.”</p>
    <p>The shadow man rolled his eyes.&nbsp;It only lasted half a second, but she was sure she saw it.</p>
    <p>Jehan had said he came to collect. She pivoted toward her mother.&nbsp;“Why is this happening?”</p>
    <p>“It’s ancient history,” Mother said.</p>
    <p>Raina turned to Jehan.</p>
    <p>“Your mother killed a man to save your father’s life,” Jehan said.&nbsp;“A man who was important to my
        employer.&nbsp;A bargain was struck.&nbsp;They kept their lives, but when he called them to service, they
        couldn’t refuse.”</p>
    <p>“That bargain was never meant to apply to our children,” Mother ground out.&nbsp;“If I knew…”</p>
    <p>“What? What would you have done, Estelle?” Jehan leaned forward. “You would’ve done exactly the same
        thing.&nbsp;You would’ve sold him your firstborn to keep Felin breathing.”</p>
    <p>Mother leaned back and smiled her charming easy smile. “You’re such a treasure, Jehan.&nbsp;We should get
        together more often.”</p>
    <p>Father reached out and put his hand on her wrist.</p>
    <p>“What happens if I don’t go?” Raina asked.</p>
    <p>“Tell her, Estelle,” Jehan said.</p>
    <p>“You’re the man with all the answers,” she told him.</p>
    <p>“We’ll report back to my employer,” Jehan said.&nbsp;“Then we’ll return, kill you, your father and mother, and
        your brother.&nbsp;We’ll poison your dragons and burn your keep.&nbsp;There will be nothing left of the name
        Belfort except a smoking ruin.”</p>
    <p>“Can they do that?” Raul asked.</p>
    <p>Nobody answered.</p>
    <p>He looked from face to face and turned to the shadow man.</p>
    <p>“Yes,” the man said.</p>
    <p>On one side, the lives of her family.&nbsp;On the other side fifteen years of her life.&nbsp;There wasn’t any
        choice, she realized.&nbsp;It’s already been decided for her.&nbsp;&nbsp;She wanted to stomp and scream that it
        wasn’t fair.</p>
    <p>“Can we kill them now?” Raul asked.</p>
    <p>“No,” Mother said.&nbsp;“If we do, the night king will just send more.”</p>
    <p>“Think about what you’re doing,” Jehan said.&nbsp;“You’ve had twenty years in the countryside, raising your
        sheep, making wine, rutting like two rabbits. I bet when you look at your hands, Estelle, you can’t even see
        blood anymore.&nbsp;But it’s still there.&nbsp;Did you really think your old sins would be forgotten?”</p>
    <p>“Raul,” Father snapped.&nbsp;“You’re excused from the table.”</p>
    <p>Her brother took off.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A change came over Mother. The kind, charming, easy-going woman had vanished.&nbsp;In her place sat a grim ghost,
        and she was contemplating murder.</p>
    <p>She had no choice, Raina realized.&nbsp;Her heart hammered against her ribs.&nbsp;“I’ll go,” Raina said.</p>
    <p>“You will not,” Father said.</p>
    <p>She had to wrestle it back from him.&nbsp;If he went to the capital, he would condemn all of them.&nbsp;She
        picked up the scroll and turned it to him.&nbsp;“It says Raina Belfort.&nbsp;See, right here.&nbsp;It doesn’t
        say Felin Belfort.”</p>
    <p>Jehan chuckled. “The curse came true, Estelle.&nbsp;You had children who are mouthy bastards just like you.”</p>
    <p>“Raina,” Mother said.&nbsp;“Don’t disrespect your father.”</p>
    <p>She had thrown one stick onto the fire.&nbsp;Might as well toss in the whole bundle. “This is a royal decree.
        What are you planning to do, Father?&nbsp;Are you going to defy our king? Will you pretend to be me? You can’t
        pass for a twenty-year-old woman even if you shave.”</p>
    <p>She looked at her father’s eyes and ran face first into an impenetrable wall of no.</p>
    <p>“This matter is settled.” Father rose.&nbsp;“Come.&nbsp;I’ll show you to your rooms.”</p>
    <p>He stared at Jehan.&nbsp;The old man tossed the rest of his wine down his throat and got up.&nbsp;The shadow man
        got up with him, and Father led them from the room.</p>
    <p>Mother leaned her elbow on the table and rested her forehead against her hands.</p>
    <p>“Who did you kill?” Raina asked quietly.</p>
    <p>“There are two kings in Bellesere,” Mother said.&nbsp;“King Charles in the Terrade Castle rules the capital by
        day.&nbsp;Alasdair Rock rules it by night.&nbsp;He is the man nightmares are made of.&nbsp;I killed his nephew.”
    </p>
    <p>“Did you do it to save Father?”</p>
    <p>Mother nodded.&nbsp;They fell silent.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;“Things that you do are never forgotten.”&nbsp;Mother’s voice was quiet as if she was talking to
        herself.&nbsp;“They follow you and eventually you have to pay for them.&nbsp;There is a price for everything.”
    </p>
    <p>She seemed so old right all the sudden.&nbsp;Old, and weak, and defeated.&nbsp;Fear squirmed through
        Raina.&nbsp;She swallowed.&nbsp;She could do something about it.&nbsp;And she would.</p>
    <p>“Stay away from Jehan,” Mother said.&nbsp;“And from his pet killer.&nbsp;That creature is an
        abomination.&nbsp;One way or the other, they’ll be gone by morning.”</p>
    <p>“Is Father going to leave with them?”</p>
    <p>Mother didn’t answer.&nbsp;She grabbed the wine bottle and hurled it at the stone wall.&nbsp;The thick glass
        bounced off the stones without shattering.&nbsp;The bottle rolled across the floor. Mother took a deep breath
        and walked out of the hall.</p>
    <p class="has-text-align-center">#</p>
    <p>Raina climbed the stairs to her room, entered, shut the door, and leaned against it.&nbsp;Her home for the last
        twenty years.&nbsp;He whole life was in the this room. She knew every nook and cranny.&nbsp;She could move
        around it in complete darkness half-asleep, never bumping into anything.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The moonlight streaming through the window barely lit the bedroom, but her memory painted it as if she saw it
        sunlight at noon. The big, solid wooden bed with cream-colored linens and her favorite pillow. The ornate table
        carved out of a solid chunk of wood for her, supporting a lantern and the last book she was reading.&nbsp;The
        shelves where her memories lived: her stuffed toy cat Snowball, once white and now mostly grey; her books; a
        small chest filled with childhood treasures of colorful chunks of glass, weird rocks, and coins from faraway
        places &#8230;&nbsp;She shut her eyes. For twenty years, this was the safest place in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her
        happy little corner. &nbsp;Her haven.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        <em>Just don’t think about it.&nbsp;You know what needs to be done.&nbsp;Just do it.</em>
    </p>
    <p>Raina crossed the room and pulled a travel bag from the chest.&nbsp;She tossed the leather holder with her
        certificate of birth into it. She pulled a small purse of money out of her dresser and dropped it into the
        bag.&nbsp;Her savings.&nbsp;Her family had money from the wool trade but asking for it now would be out of the
        question.&nbsp;She had to do this fast and quiet, before her parents realized what was happening. She threw
        clothes into the bag, socks, underwear, boar bristle toothbrush, a tin of powder, other necessities…&nbsp;She
        picked up Snowball and stuffed her into the bag.&nbsp;Then she stripped and put on the wool pants, blouse, the
        tall boots, and the riding leathers. She strapped her narrow saber to her waist, took the hat with a black
        feather off its hook, and put it on.</p>
    <p>This was it.&nbsp;There couldn’t be any goodbyes.</p>
    <p>Raina eased the door open.&nbsp;The way was clear.&nbsp;She padded down the hall and quietly knocked on Raul’s
        room.&nbsp;The door swung open, revealing her brother.</p>
    <p>“I need help,” she whispered.&nbsp;“Go to the stables and saddle both dragons.”</p>
    <p>He nodded and took off down the stairs.</p>
    <p>The royal decree lay where she’d dropped it.&nbsp;Raina rolled it back into a tube, stuffed it in its protective
        case, and hid it in her bag.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Father would’ve put them in the west side, in one of the three guest rooms.&nbsp;They were the farthest from the
        front door and the farthest from her and Raul’s bedrooms.&nbsp;Only one door showed the faint yellow glow under
        it.&nbsp;She knocked.</p>
    <p>“Come in,” Jehan called.</p>
    <p>She tried the handle of the door.&nbsp;Unlocked.&nbsp;It swung open under the pressure from her
        fingertips.&nbsp;Father didn’t lock them in.&nbsp;It wouldn’t have done much good.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        She walked in.&nbsp;Her heart was beating too fast.&nbsp;She took a deep quiet breath to steady
        herself.&nbsp;<em>Never let your enemies know what you’re thinking</em>
        , Mother’s voice said from the depth of her memories.&nbsp;<em>When you’re in your darkest moment and they scare
            you so you can’t even think, laugh in their faces. Fake it if you must.</em>
    </p>
    <p>The room stood empty, the door in the far wall ajar.&nbsp;Two figures sat on the balcony, barely visible against
        the darkness of the country night.&nbsp;She shut the door, crossed the room, and came out on the balcony.</p>
    <p>Jehan leaned against the stone rail.&nbsp;The shadow man sat on it, legs crossed.&nbsp;Neither had taken off
        their clothes.</p>
    <p>“Mother used to say Bellesere was a nest of vipers,” she said, keeping her voice light.</p>
    <p>Jehan nodded.</p>
    <p>“You’re the vipers.”</p>
    <p>“Yes.”&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“You asked me if I had a fiancé.&nbsp;Why?”</p>
    <p>“Because betrothal is a legally binding arrangement,” Jehan said.&nbsp;“There are only three ways to break it:
        money, intimidation, or murder.&nbsp;It’s harder to press someone into service after you murder their fiancé.”
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;Charming.&nbsp;“I’ll need a map,” she said.</p>
    <p>Jehan reached into his travel bag and pulled out two folded maps.&nbsp;“The top is the dragon route to
        Bellesere.&nbsp;The second is the map of the city.&nbsp;When you get to the capital, go directly to the Rock
        estate.&nbsp;Do not land anywhere else.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not speak to anyone. Try not to die on the way. Do you
        understand?”</p>
    <p>“I’m mouthy, not slow.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t mouth off to Alasdair Rock.&nbsp;It’s not wise.”</p>
    <p>She took the maps and stuffed them into her bag.&nbsp;“You’ve got what you wanted.&nbsp;Leave.&nbsp;I want to see
        you gone.”</p>
    <p>“We weren’t planning on staying.” Jehan said.&nbsp;He swiped his bag off the stone floor and walked out the
        door.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The shadow man pondered her.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>She crossed her arms on her chest.&nbsp;“Which part of ‘leave’ wasn’t clear?”</p>
    <p>He leapt off the stone rail, vanishing into deep shadows below.&nbsp;That had to be a twenty-foot jump.&nbsp;If
        there was any justice in the world, he’d break his legs.</p>
    <p>Raina leaned from the balcony and watched as Jehan got his horse out of the stables, opened the gates, mounted,
        and rode out.&nbsp;She exhaled and hugged herself.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Bellesere was one of the biggest cities on the continent.&nbsp;She’d never been outside of the
        province.&nbsp;She’d never even seen a Jute, except for an old man in Gallian clothes, who’d made his living
        protecting wool merchants’ wagons.</p>
    <p>If she thought any more about it, she wouldn’t leave.&nbsp;Now wasn’t the time for self-pity.</p>
    <p>She shouldered her bag, slipped out of the room, and snuck across the keep and out of the front door.&nbsp;The
        moon was bright, lighting the courtyard like a lantern. &nbsp;She crossed the open space at a run and dashed
        into the stables, where huge wooden gates stood wide open.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Raul waited by the dragons. He’d saddled both and led them out of their enclosures to the gates, ready to take
        off, Korvan in front and Puffles behind him.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>She hugged her brother.&nbsp;“Take Korvan and fly him.”</p>
    <p>“Where?”</p>
    <p>“Anywhere.&nbsp;As long as you keep him away from Father for a few hours.&nbsp;I need a head start.”</p>
    <p>“Don’t go,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“I have to.&nbsp;Go on.”&nbsp;</p>
    <p>He climbed into the saddle and picked up the reigns. “Out, Korvan.&nbsp;Out!”</p>
    <p>The younger drake rushed the doors, banging them open, tore into the courtyard and flew to the sky.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Raina swung into the saddle.&nbsp;“Out, Puffles!&nbsp;Go!”</p>
    <p>The dragon ran out the doors.</p>
    <p>“Raina!” Mother screamed.</p>
    <p>She turned.&nbsp;Both of her parents stood on the steps by the inner keep’s door.&nbsp;Father’s face was
        terrible.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>“I’ll send him back,” she yelled, as Puffles beat his wings.&nbsp;“He’ll come home to roost.&nbsp;I love you!”
    </p>
    <p>The aging drake took to the sky.&nbsp;Cold wind buffeted her.&nbsp;She took one last look at Belfort far below
        and turned east, toward the capital.</p>

    <p>Finally the streets ended abruptly, and the Bull Gate rose ahead, the empty space in front of it lit by torches,
        their light playing on the massive bronze gates shut tight.  High above, the city guard prowled the wall.</p>
    <p>I turned, so the gate was to my left.&nbsp;A row of tall buildings greeted me, three stories high and built
        without any spaces between them.&nbsp;The entire street was like the bottom of a stone canyon. It was meant to
        channel the flood of invaders into a narrow kill space if the gates were breached.</p>
    <p>I counted off the houses on the side of the street facing me, staring with the closest to the gate.&nbsp;One,
        two, three, four. The house with the blue door.</p>
    <p>The huge city gates opened.</p>
    <p>It was after hours.&nbsp;Only someone in a very high position could force the guards to let them in.</p>
    <p>Three riders entered the city.&nbsp;All three rode Andikan warhorses, big, quick footed, mean, with grullo coats
        that looked like grey smoke. The leading rider’s horse had a bald face, a white marking that covered the entire
        front of his head.&nbsp;It looked like a horse wore another horse’s skull as a helmet.</p>
    <p>Everard.&nbsp;The Sleepless Duke, the Bloody Sword of the West, the Shield of Ledonia, riding Ghost, his war
        stallion.&nbsp;They called him the Sleepless because he ruled over a vast stretch of territory on the Western
        border and that territory was continuously raided by the tribes from the north and the Empire from the South.
        Verard Duchy was always at war. Everard picked up a sword at the age of three and never put it down, just as his
        father and mother before him.&nbsp;He was a violent war monger, who responded to threats with overwhelming
        force.</p>
    <p>There was no place to hide. I flattened myself against the nearest house and looked down.</p>
    <p>The riders rode down the street, their dark cloaks swallowing the light as if they had cut pieces of midnight sky
        and wrapped them around themselves.</p>
    <p>
        <em>Don’t notice me.&nbsp;Don’t see me.</em>
    </p>
    <p>Ghost reached me. The size of this horse was truly shocking.&nbsp;I raised my head a fraction of an
        inch.&nbsp;The stallion glared at me with a bright blue eye, and I caught a glimpse of the rider, broad
        shoulders stretching his cloak, his hood hiding everything except for his clean-shaven square jaw.</p>
    <p>I held my breath.</p>
    <p>The riders passed me.&nbsp;The hoof steps scattered down the street, receding.</p>
    <p>That was entirely too much excitement.</p>
    <p>I took a deep breath and knocked on the blue door.</p>
    <p>No answer.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I knocked louder.</p>
    <p>A small window slid open in the door.&nbsp;The person on the other side stayed in the shadow.</p>
    <p>“Sabastian said you rent your rooms,” I said.&nbsp;Sabastian ran the stables at the White Stag.&nbsp;This house
        was owned by the widow of his nephew.</p>
    <p>“I have someone coming in tomorrow,” a woman said.</p>
    <p>“I just need it for tonight. The place I was supposed to stay was sold out from under me.”</p>
    <p>“Just you?”</p>
    <p>“Just me.”</p>
    <p>“It’s a den per night.”</p>
    <p>I passed two dens through the window.&nbsp;“For your inconvenience.&nbsp;I need some food.&nbsp;Whatever you
        have.&nbsp;I’m not picky.”</p>
    <p>Metal clung.&nbsp;The door swung open.&nbsp;A woman stood inside.&nbsp;She was about thirty, with pale skin and a
        coil of golden hair that rested on her head like a crown.&nbsp;Three months from now, a poor young noble would
        ride through the Bull Gate and rent a room here.&nbsp;He would fall in love with the widow, but he was impulsive
        and foolish, and a year later she would die in his arms, trying to keep him from being run through with a sword.
        They would kill him anyway.</p>
    <p>The widow gave me a grim look. Behind her, a little girl in a plain white nightgown, not more than four or five,
        peeked at me from the stair landing. She would die after the men who killed her mother would set the house on
        fire.</p>
    <p>“Come in,” the widow said.</p>
    <p>I came inside, and she closed the door and bolted it shut.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The woman glanced up at the landing.&nbsp;Her eyebrows came together, and the little girl scurried off. The widow
        turned left, into the kitchen, pulled a loaf of dense black bread from the basket, cut a thick slab, took a
        block of white cheese from an ice box, cut a slab of that, and handed me the giant cheese sandwich.</p>
    <p>I forced myself to not snatch it out of her hands and took it slowly.&nbsp;“Thank you.”</p>
    <p>“Third floor,” she said. “The door has a bar on both sides.&nbsp;I’m going to lock you in.”</p>
    <p>“Fine by me.”</p>
    <p>I went up the stairs, trying to ignore the food in my hands.&nbsp;My mouth watered.&nbsp;We climbed to the third
        floor, to a sturdy wooden door with a thick bar across it.&nbsp;The widow unbarred the door and pushed it open,
        revealing a small room with a bed and a window by it, with cheap, murky glass. A second door, flimsy and narrow,
        stood open in the wall on the right, leading to a tiny bathroom with a wooden toilet.</p>
    <p>“In you go. Remember, you have to be out in the morning.”</p>
    <p>I stepped in.&nbsp;She shut the door, and I heard the bar slide into place.</p>
    <p>I sat on the floor and attacked my food.</p>
