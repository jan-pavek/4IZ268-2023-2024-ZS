        <h2>Basic information</h2>
        <p>Miloš Zeman is a prominent Czech politician, known for his influential role in Czech politics. Born on
            September 28, 1944, he served as the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic from 1998 to 2002. Later, in 2013,
            Zeman became the first directly elected President of the Czech Republic. His political career has been
            marked by a pragmatic approach and a distinctive communication style. Zeman's tenure has witnessed a mix of
            policies, often characterized by his pro-Russian stance and skepticism towards certain aspects of European
            integration. His outspoken nature and unapologetic demeanor have made him a polarizing figure in Czech
            politics, generating both fervent support and staunch opposition.</p>
