            <h2>Career</h2>
            <h3>2010: Debut</h3>
            <p>Neubauer was invited to the inaugural Classic Tetris World Championship in 2010 by virtue of being one of the two people to max out the game, with the other being Harry Hong.</p>
            <p>Neubauer advanced to the final, where he defeated Harry Hong 2:0 to become the first-ever champion in the Classic Tetris World Championship.</p>
            <p>Neubauer's victory was covered in the award-winning documentary Ecstasy of Order: The Tetris Masters (2011).</p>

            <h3>2011-2013: Continued success</h3>
            <p>In 2011, Neubauer successfully defended his title after defeating Alex Kerr 2:0 in the finals.</p>
            <p>In 2012, Neubauer successfully defended his title for the second time after defeating Mike Winzineck 3:0 in the finals.</p>
            <p>In 2013, Jonas was once again able to defend his title for the third time, defeating rival Harry Hong 3:2 after being down 0:2. This marked the first time Neubauer lost a round in the finals and made him a 4-time Classic World Tetris champion and the sole champion of the competition up until this point.</p>

            <h3>2014: First CTWC defeat</h3>
            <p>Neubauer participated again in 2014, looking to defend his title for the fourth straight time. Neubauer made it to the finals, setting up a rematch with the previous year's finalist Harry Hong.</p>
            <p>Despite taking an early 1:0 lead, Neubauer was defeated 3:1 by Hong.</p>
            <p>This marked the first time Neubauer was defeated in competition, and it was Harry Hong's first and so far only Classic Tetris World Championship victory. After the tournament, Neubauer contemplated retirement but was convinced to keep competing by his wife.</p>
