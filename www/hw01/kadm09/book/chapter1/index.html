        <h3>Subchapter 1</h3>
        <a href="#toc">Back to the ToC</a>
        <p>Shadow had done three years in prison. He was big enough and looked dont-fuck-withme enough that his biggest
            problem was killing time. So he kept himself in shape, and taught himself coin tricks, and thought a lot
            about how much he loved his wife.

            The best thing—in Shadows opinion, perhaps the only good thing—about being in prison was a feeling of
            relief. The feeling that hed plunged as low as he could plunge and hed hit bottom. He didnt worry that
            the man was going to get him, because the man had got him. He was no longer scared of what tomorrow might
            bring, because yesterday had brought it.

            It did not matter, Shadow decided, if you had done what you had been convicted of or not. In his experience
            everyone he met in prison was aggrieved about something: there was always something the authorities had got
            wrong, something they said you did when you didnt—or you didnt do quite like they said you did. What was
            important was that they had gotten you.

            He had noticed it in the first few days, when everything, from the slang to the bad food, was new. Despite
            the misery and the utter skin-crawling horror of incarceration, he was breathing relief.

            Shadow tried not to talk too much.
            Somewhere around the middle of year two
            he mentioned his theory to Low Key
            Lyesmith, his cellmate.
            Low Key, who was a grifter from Minnesota,
            smiled his scarred smile. “Yeah,” he said.
            “Thats true. Its even better when youve
            been sentenced to death. Thats when you
            remember the jokes about the guys who
            kicked their boots off as the noose flipped
            around their necks, because their friends
            always told them theyd die with their boots
            on.”
            “Is that a joke?” asked Shadow.
            “Damn right. Gallows humor. Best kind there
            is.”
            “When did they last hang a man in this
            state?” asked Shadow.
            “How the hell should I know?” Lyesmith
            kept his orange-blond hair pretty much
            shaved. You could see the lines of his skull.
            “Tell you what, though. This country started
            going to hell when they stopped hanging
            folks. No gallows dirt. No gallows deals.”
            Shadow shrugged. He could see nothing
            romantic in a death sentence.
            If you didnt have a death sentence, he
            decided, then prison was, at best, only a
            temporary reprieve from life, for two
            reasons. First, life creeps back into prison.
            There are always places to go further down.
            Life goes on. And second, if you just hang in
            there, someday theyre going to have to let
            you out.
            In the beginning it was too far away for
            Shadow to focus on. Then it became a distant
            beam of hope, and he learned how to tell
            himself “this too shall pass” when the prison
            shit went down, as prison shit always did.
            One day the magic door would open and
            hed walk through it. So he marked off the
            days on his Songbirds of North America
            calendar, which was the only calendar they
            sold in the prison commissary, and the sun
            went down and he didnt see it and the sun
            came up and he didnt see it. He practiced
            coin tricks from a book he found in the
            wasteland of the prison library; and he
            worked out; and he made lists in his head of
            what hed do when he got out of prison.

        <a href="#toc">Back to the ToC</a>
        <p>Shadows lists got shorter and shorter. After
            two years he had it down to three things.
            First, he was going to take a bath. A real,
            long, serious soak, in a tub with bubbles.
            Maybe read the paper, maybe not. Some days
            he thought one way, some days the other.
            Second he was going to towel himself off,
            put on a robe. Maybe slippers. He liked the
            idea of slippers. If he smoked he would be
            smoking a pipe about now, but he didnt
            smoke. He would pick up his wife in his
            arms (“Puppy,” she would squeal in mock
            horror and real delight, “what are you
            doing?”). He would carry her into the
            bedroom, and close the door. Theyd call out
            for pizzas if they got hungry.
            Third, after he and Laura had come out of the
            bedroom, maybe a couple of days later, he
            was going to keep his head down and stay
            out of trouble for the rest of his life.
            “And then youll be happy?” asked Low Key
            Lyesmith. That day they were working in the
            prison shop, assembling bird feeders, which
            was barely more interesting than stamping
            out license plates.
            “Call no man happy,” said Shadow, “until he
            is dead.”
            “Herodotus,” said Low Key. “Hey. Youre
            learning.”
            “Who the fucks Herodotus?” asked the
            Iceman, slotting together the sides of a bird
            feeder and passing it to Shadow, who bolted
            and screwed it tight.
            “Dead Greek,” said Shadow.
            “My last girlfriend was Greek,” said the
            Iceman. “The shit her family ate. You would
            not believe. Like rice wrapped in leaves.
            Shit like that".The Iceman was the same size and shape as a
            Coke machine, with blue eyes and hair so
            blond it was almost white. He had beaten the
            crap out of some guy who had made the
            mistake of copping a feel off his girlfriend in
            the bar where she danced and the Iceman
            bounced. The guys friends had called the
            police, who arrested the Iceman and ran a
            check on him which revealed that the Iceman
            had walked from a work-release program
            eighteen months earlier.
            “So what was I supposed to do?” asked the
            Iceman, aggrieved, when he had told Shadow
            the whole sad tale. “Id told him she was my
            girlfriend. Was I supposed to let him
            disrespect me like that? Was I? I mean, he
            had his hands all over her.”
            Keep your head down. Do your own
            time.Shadow had said, “You tell em,” and
            left it at that. One thing he had learned early,
            you do your own time in prison. You dont
            do anyone elses time for them.
            Lyesmith had loaned Shadow a battered
            paperback copy of Herodotuss Histories
            several months earlier. “Its not boring. Its
            cool,” he said, when Shadow protested that
            he didnt read books. “Read it first, then tell
            me its cool.”
            Shadow had made a face, but he had started
            to read, and had found himself hooked
            against his will.

            “Did you really?” He looked at Shadow
            intently, the birthmark on his forehead
            lowering. Shadow thought about telling the
            man some of his theories about prison, but he
            said nothing. He nodded, instead, and
            concentrated on appearing properly
            remorseful.
            “Says here youve got a wife, Shadow.”
            “Her names Laura.”
            “Hows everything there?”
            “Pretty good. Shes come down to see me as
            much as she could—its a long way to travel.
            We write and I call her when I can.”
            “What does your wife do?”
            “Shes a travel agent. Sends people all over
            the world.”
            “Howd you meet her?”
            Shadow could not decide why the man was
            asking. He considered telling him it was
            none of his business, then said, “She was my
            best buddys wifes best friend. They set us
            up on a blind date. We hit it off.”
            “And youve got a job waiting for you?”
            “Yessir. My buddy, Robbie, the one I just
            told you about, he owns the Muscle Farm, the
            place I used to train. He says my old job is
            waiting for me.”
            An eyebrow raised. “Really?”
            “Says he figures Ill be a big draw. Bring
            back some old-timers, and pull in the tough
            crowd who want to be tougher.”
            The man seemed satisfied. He chewed the
            end of his ballpoint pen, then turned over the
            sheet of paper.
            “How do you feel about your offense?”
            Shadow shrugged. “I was stupid,” he said,
            and meant it.
            The man with the birthmark sighed. He
            ticked off a number of items on a checklist.
            Then he riffled through the papers in
            Shadows file. “Howre you getting home
            from here?” he asked. “Greyhound?”
            “Flying home. Its good to have a wife whos
            a travel agent.”
            The man frowned, and the birthmark creased.
            “She sent you a ticket?”
            “Didnt need to. Just sent me a confirmation
            number. Electronic ticket. All I have to do is
            turn up at the airport in a month and show
            em my ID, and Im outta here.”
            The man nodded, scribbled one final note,
            then he closed the file and put down the
            ballpoint pen. Two pale hands rested on the
            gray desk like pink animals. He brought his
            hands close together, made a steeple of his
            forefingers, and stared at Shadow with
            watery hazel eyes.
            “Youre lucky,” he said. “You have someone
            to go back to, you got a job waiting. You can
            put all this behind you. You got a second
            chance. Make the most of it.”
            The man did not offer to shake Shadows
            hand as he rose to leave, nor did Shadow
            expect him to.
            The last week was the worst. In some ways
            it was worse than the whole three years put
            together. Shadow wondered if it was the
            weather: oppressive, still, and cold. It felt as
            if a storm was on the way, but the storm
            never came. He had the jitters and the
            heebie-jeebies, a feeling deep in his stomach
            that something was entirely wrong. In the
            exercise yard the wind gusted. Shadow
            imagined that he could smell snow on the air.
            He called his wife collect. Shadow knew
            that the phone companies whacked a three-
            dollar surcharge on every call made from a
            prison phone. That was why operators are
            always real polite to people calling from
            prisons, Shadow had decided: they knew that
            he paid their wages.
            “Something feels weird,” he told Laura. That
            wasnt the first thing he said to her. The first
            thing was “I love you,” because its a good
            thing to say if you can mean it, and Shadow
            did.
            “Hello,” said Laura. “I love you too. What
            feels weird?”
            “I dont know,” he said. “Maybe the
            weather. It feels like if we could only get a
            storm, everything would be okay.”
            “Its nice here,” she said. “The last of the
            leaves havent quite fallen. If we dont get a
            storm, youll be able to see them when you
            get home.”
            “Five days,” said Shadow.
            “A hundred and twenty hours, and then you
            come home,” she said.
            “Everything okay there? Nothing wrong?”
            “Everythings fine. Im seeing Robbie
            tonight. Were planning your surprise
            welcome-home party.”
            “Surprise party?”
            “Of course. You dont know anything about
            it, do you?”
            “Not a thing.”
            “Thats my husband,” she said. Shadow
            realized that he was smiling. He had been
            inside for three years, but she could still
            make him smile.
            “Love you, babes,” said Shadow.
            “Love you, puppy,” said Laura.
            Shadow put down the phone.

        <h3>Subchapter 3</h3>
        <a href="#toc">Back to the ToC</a>
        <p>When they got married Laura told Shadow that she wanted a puppy, but their landlord
            had pointed out they werent allowed pets
            under the terms of their lease. “Hey,”
            Shadow had said, “Ill be your puppy. What
            do you want me to do? Chew your slippers?
            Piss on the kitchen floor? Lick your nose?
            Sniff your crotch? I bet theres nothing a
            puppy can do I cant do!” And he picked her
            up as if she weighed nothing at all and began
            to lick her nose while she giggled and
            shrieked, and then he carried her to the bed.
            In the food hall Sam Fetisher sidled over to
            Shadow and smiled, showing his old teeth.
            He sat down beside Shadow and began to eat
            his macaroni and cheese.
            “We got to talk,” said Sam Fetisher.Sam Fetisher was one of the blackest men
            that Shadow had ever seen. He might have
            been sixty. He might have been eighty. Then
            again, Shadow had met thirty-year-old
            crackheads who looked older than Sam
            Fetisher.
            “Mm?” said Shadow.
            “Storms on the way,” said Sam.
            “Feels like it,” said Shadow. “Maybe itll
            snow soon.”
            “Not that kind of storm. Bigger storm than
            that coming. I tell you, boy, youre better off
            in here than out on the street when the big
            storm comes.”
            “Done my time,” said Shadow. “Friday, Im
            gone.”
            Sam Fetisher stared at Shadow. “Where you
            from?” he asked.
            “Eagle Point. Indiana.”
            “Youre a lying fuck,” said Sam Fetisher. “I
            mean originally. Where are your folks
            from?”
            “Chicago,” said Shadow. His mother had
            lived in Chicago as a girl, and she had died
            there, half a lifetime ago.
            “Like I said. Big storm coming. Keep your
            head down, Shadow-boy. Its like . . . what
            do they call those things continents ride
            around on? Some kind of plates?”
            “Tectonic plates?” Shadow hazarded.
            “Thats it. Tectonic plates. Its like when
            they go riding, when North America goes
            skidding into South America, you dont want
            to be in the middle. You dig me?”
            “Not even a little.”
            One brown eye closed in a slow wink.
            “Hell, dont say I didnt warn you,” said
            Sam Fetisher, and he spooned a trembling
            lump of orange Jell-O into his mouth.
            “I wont.”
            Shadow spent the night half-awake, drifting
            in and out of sleep, listening to his new
            cellmate grunt and snore in the bunk below
            him. Several cells away a man whined and
            howled and sobbed like an animal, and from
            time to time someone would scream at him to
            shut the fuck up. Shadow tried not to hear.
            He let the empty minutes wash over him,
            lonely and slow.
            Two days to go. Forty-eight hours, starting
            with oatmeal and prison coffee, and a guard
            named Wilson who tapped Shadow harder
            than he had to on the shoulder and said,
            “Shadow? This way.”
            Shadow checked his conscience. It was
            quiet, which did not, he had observed, in a
            prison, mean that he was not in deep shit.
            The two men walked more or less side by
            side, feet echoing on metal and concrete.
            Shadow tasted fear in the back of his throat,
            bitter as old coffee. The bad thing was
            happening. . . .
            There was a voice in the back of his head
            whispering that they were going to slap
            another year onto his sentence, drop him into
            solitary, cut off his hands, cut off his head.
            He told himself he was being stupid, but his
            heart was pounding fit to burst out of his
            chest.
            “I dont get you, Shadow,” said Wilson, as
            they walked.
            “Whats not to get, sir?”
            “You. Youre too fucking quiet. Too polite.
            You wait like the old guys, but youre what?
            Twenty-five? Twenty-eight?”
            “Thirty-two, sir.”
            “And what are you? A spic? A gypsy?”
            “Not that I know of, sir. Maybe.”
            “Maybe you got nigger blood in you. You got
            nigger blood in you, Shadow?”
            “Could be, sir.” Shadow stood tall and
            looked straight ahead, and concentrated on
            not allowing himself to be riled by this man.
            “Yeah? Well, all I know is, you fucking
            spook me.” Wilson had sandy blond hair and
            a sandy blond face and a sandy blond smile.
            “You leaving us soon.”
            “Hope so, sir.”
            They walked through a couple of
            checkpoints. Wilson showed his ID each
            time. Up a set of stairs, and they were
            standing outside the prison wardens office.
            It had the prison wardens name—G.
            Patterson—on the door in black letters, and
            beside the door, a miniature traffic light.
            The top light burned red.
            Wilson pressed a button below the traffic
            light.
            They stood there in silence for a couple of
            minutes. Shadow tried to tell himself that
            everything was all right, that on Friday
            morning hed be on the plane up to Eagle
            Point, but he did not believe it himself.
            The red light went out and the green light
            went on, and Wilson opened the door. They
            went inside.
            Shadow had seen the warden a handful of
            times in the last three years. Once he had
            been showing a politician around. Once,
            during a lockdown, the warden had spoken to
            them in groups of a hundred, telling them that
            the prison was overcrowded, and that, since
            it would remain overcrowded, they had
            better get used to it.
            Up close, Patterson looked worse. His face
            was oblong, with gray hair cut into a military
            bristle cut. He smelled of Old Spice. Behind
            him was a shelf of books, each with the word
            Prison in the title; his desk was perfectly
            clean, empty but for a telephone and a tear-
            off-the-pages Far Side calendar. He had a
            hearing aid in his right ear.
            “Please, sit down.”
            Shadow sat down. Wilson stood behind him.
            The warden opened a desk drawer and took
            out a file, placed it on his desk.
            “Says here you were sentenced to six years
            for aggravated assault and battery. Youve
            served three years. You were due to be
            released on Friday.”
            Were? Shadow felt his stomach lurch inside
            him. He wondered how much longer he was
            going to have to serve—another year? Two
            years? All three? All he said was “Yes, sir.”
            The warden licked his lips. “What did you
            say?”
            “I said, ‘Yes, sir. “
            “Shadow, were going to be releasing you
            later this afternoon. Youll be getting out a
            couple of days early.” Shadow nodded, and
            he waited for the other shoe to drop. The
            warden looked down at the paper on his
            desk. “This came from the Johnson Memorial
            Hospital in Eagle Point . . . Your wife. She
            died in the early hours of this morning. It was
            an automobile accident. Im sorry.”
            Shadow nodded once more.
            Wilson walked him back to his cell, not
            saying anything. He unlocked the cell door
            and let Shadow in. Then he said, “Its like
            one of them good news, bad news jokes,
            isnt it? Good news, were letting you out
            early, bad news, your wife is dead.” He
            laughed, as if it were genuinely funny.
            Shadow said nothing at all.
            Numbly, he packed up his possessions, gave
            most of them away. He left behind Low
            Keys Herodotus and the book of coin tricks,
            and, with a momentary pang, he abandoned
            the blank metal disks he had smuggled out of
            the workshop, which had served him for
            coins. There would be coins, real coins, on
            the outside. He shaved. He dressed in
            civilian clothes. He walked through door
            after door, knowing that he would never
            walk back through them again, feeling empty
            inside.
            The rain had started to gust from the gray
            sky, a freezing rain. Pellets of ice stung
            Shadows face, while the rain soaked the
            thin overcoat and they walked toward the
            yellow ex–school bus that would take them
            to the nearest city.
            By the time they got to the bus they were
            soaked. Eight of them were leaving. Fifteen
            hundred still inside. Shadow sat on the bus
            and shivered until the heaters started
            working, wondering what he was doing,
            where he would go now.
            Ghost images filled his head, unbidden. In
            his imagination he was leaving another
            prison, long ago.
            He had been imprisoned in a lightless room
            for far too long: his beard was wild and his
            hair was a tangle. The guards had walked
            him down a gray stone stairway and out into
            a plaza filled with brightly colored things,
            with people and with objects. It was a
            market day and he was dazzled by the noise
            and the color, squinting at the sunlight that
            filled the square, smelling the salt-wet air
            and all the good things of the market, and on
            his left the sun glittered from the water . . .
            The bus shuddered to a halt at a red light.
            The wind howled about the bus, and the
            wipers slooshed heavily back and forth
            across the windshield, smearing the city into
            a red and yellow neon wetness. It was early
            afternoon, but it looked like night through the
            glass.
            “Shit,” said the man in the seat behind
            Shadow, rubbing the condensation from the
            window with his hand, staring at a wet figure
            hurrying down the sidewalk. “Theres pussy
            out there.”
            Shadow swallowed. It occurred to him that
            he had not cried yet—had in fact felt nothing
            at all. No tears. No sorrow. Nothing.
            He found himself thinking about a guy named
            Johnnie Larch hed shared a cell with when
            hed first been put inside, who told Shadow
            how hed once got out after five years behind
            bars with one hundred dollars and a ticket to
            Seattle, where his sister lived.
            Johnnie Larch had got to the airport, and he
            handed his ticket to the woman on the
            counter, and she asked to see his drivers
            license.
            He showed it to her. It had expired a couple of years earlier. She told him it was not
            valid as ID. He told her it might not be valid
            as a drivers license, but it sure as hell was
            fine identification, and damn it, who else did
            she think he was, if he wasnt him?
            She said shed thank him to keep his voice
            down.
            He told her to give him a fucking boarding
            pass, or she was going to regret it, and that
            he wasnt going to be disrespected. You
            dont let people disrespect you in prison.
            Then she pressed a button, and few moments
            later the airport security showed up, and they
            tried to persuade Johnnie Larch to leave the
            airport quietly, and he did not wish to leave,
            and there was something of an altercation.
            The upshot of it all was that Johnnie Larch
            never actually made it to Seattle, and he
            spent the next couple of days in town in bars,
            and when his one hundred dollars was gone
            he held up a gas station with a toy gun for
            money to keep drinking, and the police
            finally picked him up for pissing in the street.
            Pretty soon he was back inside serving the
            rest of his sentence and a little extra for the
            gas station job.
            And the moral of this story, according to
            Johnnie Larch, was this: dont piss off
            people who work in airports.
            “Are you sure its not something like ‘The
            kind of behavior that works in a specialized
            environment, such as prison, can fail to work
            and in fact become harmful when used
            outside such an environment?” said
            Shadow, when Johnnie Larch told him the
            story.
            “No, listen to me, Im telling you, man,” said
            Johnnie Larch, “dont piss off those bitches
            in airports.”
            Shadow half smiled at the memory. His own
            drivers license had several months still to
            go before it expired.
            “Bus station! Everybody out!”
            The building stank of piss and sour beer.
            Shadow climbed into a taxi and told the
            driver to take him to the airport. He told him
            that there was an extra five dollars if he
            could do it in silence. They made it in twenty
            minutes and the driver never said a word.
            Then Shadow was stumbling through the
            brightly lit airport terminal. Shadow worried
            about the whole e-ticket business. He knew
            he had a ticket for a flight on Friday, but he
            didnt know if it would work today. Anything
            electronic seemed fundamentally magical to
            Shadow, and liable to evaporate at any
            moment.
            Still, he had his wallet, back in his
            possession for the first time in three years,
            containing several expired credit cards and
            one Visa card, which, he was pleasantly
            surprised to discover, didnt expire until the
            end of January. He had a reservation number.
            And, he realized, he had the certainty that
            once he got home everything would,
            somehow, be okay. Laura would be fine
            again. Maybe it was some kind of scam to
            spring him a few days early. Or perhaps it
            was a simple mix-up: some other Laura
            Moons body had been dragged from the
            highway wreckage.
            Lightning flickered outside the airport,
            through the windows-walls. Shadow
            realized he was holding his breath, waiting
            for something. A distant boom of thunder. He
            exhaled.
            A tired white woman stared at him from
            behind the counter.
            “Hello,” said Shadow. Youre the first
            strange woman Ive spoken to, in the flesh, in
            three years. “Ive got an e-ticket number. I
            was supposed to be traveling on Friday but I
            have to go today. There was a death in my
            family.”
            “Mm. Im sorry to hear that.” She tapped at
            the keyboard, stared at the screen, tapped
            again. “No problem. Ive put you on the
            three-thirty. It may be delayed because of the
            storm, so keep an eye on the screens.
            Checking any baggage?”
            He held up a shoulder bag. “I dont need to
            check this, do I?”
            “No,” she said. “Its fine. Do you have any
            picture ID?”
            Shadow showed her his drivers license.
            It was not a big airport, but the number of
            people wandering, just wandering, amazed
            him. He watched people put down bags
            casually, observed wallets stuffed into back
            pockets, saw purses put down, unwatched,
            under chairs. That was when he realized he
            was no longer in prison.
            Thirty minutes to wait until boarding.
            Shadow bought a slice of pizza and burned
            his lip on the hot cheese. He took his change
            and went to the phones. Called Robbie at the
            Muscle Farm, but the machine picked up.
            “Hey Robbie,” said Shadow. “They tell me
            that Lauras dead. They let me out early. Im
            coming home.”
            Then, because people do make mistakes,
            hed seen it happen, he called home, and
            listened to Lauras voice.
            “Hi,” she said. “Im not here or I cant come
            to the phone. Leave a message and Ill get
            back to you. And have a good day.”
            Shadow couldnt bring himself to leave a
            message.
            He sat in a plastic chair by the gate, and held
            his bag so tight he hurt his hand</p>
