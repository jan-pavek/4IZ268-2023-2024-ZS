        <h3>Subchapter 1</h3>
        <a href="#toc">Back to the ToC</a>
        <p>In a dark red room—the color of the walls is
            close to that of raw liver—is a tall woman
            dressed cartoonishly in too-tight silk shorts,
            her breasts pulled up and pushed forward by
            the yellow blouse tied beneath them. Her
            black hair is piled high and knotted on top of
            her head. Standing beside her is a short man
            wearing an olive T-shirt and expensive blue
            jeans. He is holding, in his right hand, a
            wallet and a Nokia mobile phone with a red-
            white-and-blue faceplate.
            The red room contains a bed, upon which are
            white satin-style sheets and an oxblood
            bedspread. At the foot of the bed is a small
            wooden table, upon which is a small stone
            statue of a woman with enormous hips, and a
            candleholder.
            The woman hands the man a small red
            candle. “Here,” she says. “Light it.”
            “Me?”
            “Yes,” she says, “If you want to have me.”
            “I shoulda just got you to suck me off in the
            car.”
            “Perhaps,” she says. “Dont you want me?”
            Her hand runs up her body from thigh to
            breast, a gesture of presentation, as if she
            were demonstrating a new product.
            Red silk scarves over the lamp in the corner
            of the room make the light red.
            The man looks at her hungrily, then he takes
            the candle from her and pushes it into the
            candleholder. “You got a light?”
            She passes him a book of matches. He tears
            off a match, lights the wick: it flickers and
            then burns with a steady flame, which gives
            the illusion of motion to the faceless statue
            beside it, all hips and breasts.
            “Put the money beneath the statue.”
            “Fifty bucks.”
            “Yes,” she says. “Now, come love me.”
            He unbuttons his blue jeans and removes his
            olive T-shirt. She massages his white
            shoulders with her brown fingers; then she
            turns him over and begins to make love to
            him with her hands, and her fingers, and her
            tongue.
            It seems to him that the lights in the red room
            have been dimmed, and the sole illumination
            comes from the candle, which burns with a
            bright flame.
            “Whats your name?” he asks her.
            “Bilquis,” she tells him, raising her head.
            “With a Q.”
            “A what?”
            “Never mind.”
            He is gasping now. “Let me fuck you,” he
            says. “I have to fuck you.”
            “Okay, hon,” she says. “Well do it. But will
            you do something for me, while youre doing
            it?”
            “Hey,” he says, suddenly tetchy, “Im paying
            you, you know.”
            She straddles him, in one smooth movement,
            whispering, “I know, honey, I know, youre
            paying me, and I mean, look at you, I should
            be paying you, Im so lucky . . .”
            He purses his lips, trying to show that her
            hooker talk is having no effect on him, he
            cant be taken; that shes a street whore, for
            Chrissakes, while hes practically a
            producer, and he knows all about last-minute
            ripoffs, but she doesnt ask for money.
            Instead she says, “Honey, while youre
            giving it to me, while youre pushing that big
            hard thing inside of me, will you worship
            me?”

            “Will I what?”
            She is rocking back and forth on him: the
            engorged head of his penis is being rubbed
            against the wet lips of her vulva.
            “Will you call me goddess? Will you pray to
            me? Will you worship me with your body?”
            He smiles. Is that all she wants? Weve all
            got our kinks, at the end of the day. “Sure,”
            he says. She reaches her hand between her
            legs and slips him inside her.
            “Is that good, is it, goddess?” he asks,
            gasping.
            “Worship me, honey,” says Bilquis, the
            hooker.
            “Yes,” he says. “I worship your breasts and
            your hair and your cunt. I worship your
            thighs and your eyes and your cherry-red lips
            . . .”
            “Yes . . .” she croons, riding him.
            “I worship your nipples, from which the milk
            of life flows. Your kiss is honey and your
            touch scorches like fire, and I worship it.”
            His words are becoming more rhythmic now,
            keeping pace with the thrust and roll of their
            bodies. “Bring me your lust in the morning,
            and bring me relief and your blessing in the
            evening. Let me walk in dark places
            unharmed and let me come to you once more
            and sleep beside you and make love with you
            again. I worship you with everything that is
            within me, and everything inside my mind,
            with everywhere Ive been and my dreams
            and my . . .” he breaks off, panting for breath.
            “What are you doing? That feels amazing. So
            amazing . . .” and he looks down at his hips,
            at the place where the two of them conjoin,
            but her forefinger touches his chin and
            pushes his head back, so he is looking only at
            her face and at the ceiling once again.
            “Keep talking, honey,” she says. “Dont stop.
            Doesnt it feel good?”
            “It feels better than anything has ever felt,”
            he tells her, meaning it as he says it. “Your
            eyes are stars, burning in the, shit, the
            firmament, and your lips are gentle waves
            that lick the sand, and I worship them,” and
            now hes thrusting deeper and deeper inside
            her: he feels electric, as if his whole lower
            body has become sexually charged: priapic,
            engorged, blissful.

            “Bring me your gift,” he mutters, no longer
            knowing what he is saying, “your one true
            gift, and make me always this . . . always so
            . . . I pray . . . I . . .”
            And then the pleasure crests into orgasm,
            blasting his mind into void, his head and self
            and entire being a perfect blank as he thrusts
            deeper into her and deeper still . . .
            Eyes closed, spasming, he luxuriates in the
            moment; and then he feels a lurch, and it
            seems to him that he is hanging, head down,
            although the pleasure continues.
            He opens his eyes.
            He thinks, grasping for thought and reason
            again, of birth, and wonders, without fear, in
            a moment of perfect postcoital clarity,
            whether what he sees is some kind of
            illusion.
            This is what he sees:
            He is inside her to the chest, and as he stares
            at this in disbelief and wonder she rests both
            hands upon his shoulders and puts gentle
            pressure on his body.
            He slipslides further inside her.
            “How are you doing this to me?” he asks, or
            he thinks he asks, but perhaps it is only in his
            head.
            “Youre doing it, honey,” she whispers. He
            feels the lips of her vulva tight around his
            upper chest and back, constricting and
            enveloping him. He wonders what this
            would look like to somebody watching them.
            He wonders why he is not scared. And then
            he knows.
            “I worship you with my body,” he whispers,
            as she pushes him inside her. Her labia pull
            slickly across his face, and his eyes slip into
            darkness.
            She stretches on the bed, like a huge cat, and
            then she yawns. “Yes,” she says. “You do.”
            The Nokia phone plays a high, electrical
            transposition of the “Ode to Joy.” She picks
            it up, and thumbs a key, and puts the
            telephone to her ear.
            Her belly is flat, her labia small and closed.
            A sheen of sweat glistens on her forehead
            and on her upper lip.
            “Yeah?” she says. And then she says, “No,
            honey, hes not here. Hes gone away.”
            She turns the telephone off before she flops
            out on the bed in the dark red room, then she
            stretches once more, and she closes her eyes,
            and she sl
