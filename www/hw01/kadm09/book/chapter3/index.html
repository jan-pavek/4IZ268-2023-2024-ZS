        <a href="#toc">Back to the ToC</a>
        <p>He was thinking about the first time he had
            ever seen Laura. He hadnt even known her
            name then. She was Audrey Burtons friend.
            He had been sitting with Robbie in a booth at
            Chi-Chis when Laura had walked in a pace
            or so behind Audrey, and Shadow had found
            himself staring. She had long, chestnut hair
            and eyes so blue Shadow mistakenly thought
            she was wearing tinted contact lenses. She
            had ordered a strawberry daiquiri, and
            insisted that Shadow taste it, and laughed
            delightedly when he did.
            Laura loved people to taste what she tasted.
            He had kissed her good night that night, and
            she had tasted like strawberry daiquiris, and
            he had never wanted to kiss anyone else
            again.
            A woman announced that his plane was
            boarding, and Shadows row was the first to
            be called. He was in the very back, an empty
            seat beside him. The rain pattered
            continually against the side of the plane: he
            imagined small children tossing down dried
            peas by the handful from the skies.
            As the plane took off he fell asleep.
            Shadow was in a dark place, and the thing
            staring at him wore a buffalos head, rank
            and furry with huge wet eyes. Its body was a
            mans body, oiled and slick.
            “Changes are coming,” said the buffalo
            without moving its lips. “There are certain
            decisions that will have to be made.”
            Firelight flickered from wet cave walls.
            “Where am I?” Shadow asked.
            “In the earth and under the earth,” said the
            buffalo man. “You are where the forgotten
            wait.” His eyes were liquid black marbles,
            and his voice was a rumble from beneath the
            world. He smelled like wet cow. “Believe,”
            said the rumbling voice. “If you are to
            survive, you must believe.”
            “Believe what?” asked Shadow. “What
            should I believe?”
            He stared at Shadow, the buffalo man, and he
            drew himself up huge, and his eyes filled
            with fire. He opened his spit-flecked buffalo
            mouth and it was red inside with the flames
            that burned inside him, under the earth.
            “Everything,” roared the buffalo man.
            The world tipped and spun, and Shadow was
            on the plane once more; but the tipping
            continued. In the front of the plane a woman
            screamed halfheartedly.
            Lightning burst in blinding flashes around the
            plane. The captain came on the intercom to
            tell them that he was going to try and gain
            some altitude, to get away from the storm.
            The plane shook and shuddered, and Shadow
            wondered, coldly and idly, if he was going
            to die. It seemed possible, he decided, but
            unlikely. He stared out of the window and
            watched the lightning illuminate the horizon.
            Then he dozed once more, and dreamed he
            was back in prison and that Low Key had
            whispered to him in the food line that
            someone had put out a contract on his life,
            but that Shadow could not find out who or
            why; and when he woke up they were coming
            in for a landing.
            He stumbled off the plane, blinking into
            wakefulness.

        <h3>Subchapter 2</h3>
        <a href="#toc">Back to the ToC</a>
        <p>
            All airports, he thought, look very much the
            same. It doesnt actually matter where you
            are, you are in an airport: tiles and
            walkways and restrooms, gates and
            newsstands and fluorescent lights. This
            airport looked like an airport. The trouble is,
            this wasnt the airport he was going to. This
            was a big airport, with way too many
            people, and way too many gates.
            “Excuse me, maam?”
            The woman looked at him over the
            clipboard. “Yes?”
            “What airport is this?”
            She looked at him, puzzled, trying to decide
            whether or not he was joking, then she said,
            “St. Louis.”
            “I thought this was the plane to Eagle Point.”
            “It was. They redirected it here because of
            the storms. Didnt they make an
            announcement?”
            “Probably. I fell asleep.”
            “Youll need to talk to that man over there, in
            the red coat.”
            The man was almost as tall as Shadow: he
            looked like the father from a seventies
            sitcom, and he tapped something into a
            computer and told Shadow to run—run!—to
            a gate on the far side of the terminal.
            Shadow ran through the airport, but the doors
            were already closed when he got to the gate.
            He watched the plane pull away from the
            gate, through the plate glass.
            The woman at the passenger assistance desk
            (short and brown, with a mole on the side of
            her nose) consulted with another woman and
            made a phone call (“Nope, that ones out.
            Theyve just cancelled it.”) then she printed
            out another boarding card. “This will get you
            there,” she told him. “Well call ahead to the
            gate and tell them youre coming.”
            Shadow felt like a pea being flicked between
            three cups, or a card being shuffled through a
            deck. Again he ran through the airport,
            ending up near where he had gotten off
            originally.
            A small man at the gate took his boarding
            pass. “Weve been waiting for you,” he
            confided, tearing off the stub of the boarding
            pass, with Shadows seat assignment—17D
            —on it. Shadow hurried onto the plane, and
            they closed the door behind him.
            He walked through first class—there were
            only four first-class seats, three of which
            were occupied. The bearded man in a pale
            suit seated next to the unoccupied seat at the
            very front grinned at Shadow as he got onto
            the plane, then raised his wrist and tapped
            his watch as Shadow walked past.
            Yeah, yeah, Im making you late, thought
            Shadow. Let that be the worst of your
            worries

        <h3>Subchapter 3</h3>
        <a href="#toc">Back to the ToC</a>
        <p>The plane seemed pretty full, as he made his
            way down toward the back. Actually,
            Shadow found, it was completely full, and
            there was a middle-aged woman sitting in
            seat 17D. Shadow showed her his boarding
            card stub, and she showed him hers: they
            matched.
            “Can you take your seat, please?” asked the
            flight attendant.
            “No,” he said, “Im afraid I cant.”
            She clicked her tongue and checked their
            boarding cards, then she led him back up to
            the front of the plane and pointed him to the
            empty seat in first class. “Looks like its
            your lucky day,” she told him. “Can I bring
            you something to drink? Well just have time
            before we take off. And Im sure you need
            one after that.”
            “Id like a beer, please,” said Shadow.
            “Whatever youve got.”
            The flight attendant went away.
            The man in the pale suit in the seat beside
            Shadow tapped his watch with his fingernail.
            It was a black Rolex. “Youre late,” said the
            man, and he grinned a huge grin with no
            warmth in it at all.
            “Sorry?”
            “I said, youre late.”
            The flight attendant handed Shadow a glass
            of beer.
            For one moment, he wondered if the man
            was crazy, and then he decided he must have
            been referring to the plane, waiting for one
            last passenger. “Sorry if I held you up,” he said, politely. “You in a hurry?”
            The plane backed away from the gate. The
            flight attendant came back and took away
            Shadows beer. The man in the pale suit
            grinned at her and said, “Dont worry, Ill
            hold onto this tightly,” and she let him keep
            his glass of Jack Daniels, while protesting,
            weakly, that it violated airline regulations.
            (“Let me be the judge of that, mdear.”)
            “Time is certainly of the essence,” said the
            man. “But no. I was merely concerned that
            you would not make the plane.”
            “That was kind of you.”
            The plane sat restlessly on the ground,
            engines throbbing, aching to be off.
            “Kind my ass,” said the man in the pale suit.
            “Ive got a job for you, Shadow.”
            A roar of engines. The little plane jerked
            forward, pushing Shadow back into his seat.
            Then they were airborne, and the airport
            lights were falling away below them.
            Shadow looked at the man in the seat next to
            him.
            His hair was a reddish gray; his beard, little
            more than stubble, was grayish red. A
            craggy, square face with pale gray eyes. The
            suit looked expensive, and was the color of
            melted vanilla ice cream. His tie was dark
            gray silk, and the tie pin was a tree, worked
            in silver: trunk, branches, and deep roots.
            He held his glass of Jack Daniels as they
            took off, and did not spill a drop.
            “Arent you going to ask me what kind of
            job?” he asked.
            “How do you know who I am?”
            The man chuckled. “Oh, its the easiest thing
            in the world to know what people call
            themselves. A little thought, a little luck, a
            little memory. Ask me what kind of job.”
            “No,” said Shadow. The attendant brought
            him another glass of beer, and he sipped at it.
            “Why not?”
            “Im going home. Ive got a job waiting for
            me there. I dont want any other job.”
            The mans craggy smile did not change,
            outwardly, but now he seemed, actually,
            amused. “You dont have a job waiting for
            you at home,” he said. “You have nothing
            waiting for you there. Meanwhile, I am
            offering you a perfectly legal job—good
            money, limited security, remarkable fringe
            benefits. Hell, if you live that long, I could
            throw in a pension plan. You think maybe
            youd like one of them?”
            Shadow said, “You must have seen my name
            on the side of my bag.”
            The man said nothing.
            “Whoever you are,” said Shadow, “you
            couldnt have known I was going to be on
            this plane. I didnt know I was going to be on
            this plane, and if my plane hadnt been
            diverted to St. Louis, I wouldnt have been.
            My guess is youre a practical joker. Maybe
            youre hustling something. But I think maybe
            well have a better time if we end this
            conversation here.”
            The man shrugged.
            Shadow picked up the in-flight magazine.
            The little plane jerked and bumped through
            the sky, making it harder to concentrate. The
            words floated through his mind like soap
            bubbles, there as he read them, gone
            completely a moment later.
            The man sat quietly in the seat beside him,
            sipping his Jack Daniels. His eyes were
            closed.
            Shadow read the list of in-flight music
            channels available on transatlantic flights,
            and then he was looking at the map of the
            world with red lines on it that showed where
            the airline flew. Then he had finished
            reading the magazine, and, reluctantly, he
            closed the cover and slipped it into the
            pocket.
            The man opened his eyes. There was
            something strange about his eyes, Shadow
            thought. One of them was a darker gray than
            the other. He looked at Shadow. “By the
            way,” he said, “I was sorry to hear about
            your wife, Shadow. A great loss.”
            Shadow nearly hit the man, then. Instead he
            took a deep breath. (“Like I said, dont piss
            off those bitches in airports,” said Johnnie
            Larch, in the back of his mind, “or theyll
            haul your sorry ass back here before you can
            spit.”) He counted to five.
            “So was I,” he said.
            The man shook his head. “If it could but have
            been any other way,” he said, and sighed.
            “She died in a car crash,” said Shadow.
            “There are worse ways to die.”
            The man shook his head, slowly. For a
            moment it seemed to Shadow as if the man
            was insubstantial; as if the plane had
            suddenly become more real, while his
            neighbor had become less so.
            “Shadow,” he said. “Its not a joke. Its not a
            trick. I can pay you better than any other job
            you find will pay you. Youre an ex-con.
            There wont be a long line of people
            elbowing each other out of the way to hire
            you.”
            “Mister whoever-the-fuck you are,” said
            Shadow, just loud enough to be heard over
            the din of the engines, “there isnt enough
            money in the world.”</p>
