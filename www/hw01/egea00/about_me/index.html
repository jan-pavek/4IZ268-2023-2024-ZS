                <p>It is important to note that the percentage of scientists who agree with a particular theory or idea can vary depending on the specific field of science and the specific question being asked. For example, there is a very high level of agreement among climate scientists that human activity is the primary cause of global warming, but there is less agreement among scientists on other topics, such as the best way to treat cancer or the origins of the universe.</p>

                    Existing competition poses a significant threat to the company because there are many players in the market, such as various pizza chains and restaurants. 
                    It is necessary to focus on distinguishing oneself from the competition by providing benefits to the customer. In addition, it is necessary to consider the rise of online food delivery platforms and meal kit services, where there is also intense competition.
