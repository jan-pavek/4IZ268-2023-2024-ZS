        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>Vondroušová is a former world No. 1 junior. She made her debut on the ITF Junior Circuit at the age of 13 and won both the singles and doubles events at her first tournament, the Grade 5 San Michel International Tournament in Malta in April 2013. Later in the year, she won a higher-level Grade 4 singles event in Poland as well as a separate Grade 2 doubles event in the Czech Republic. Vondroušová made her Grade 1 debut with a singles semifinal in January 2014, which she followed with a second round loss in her debut at the highest-level Grade A tournaments in May.</p>
        <p>At Wimbledon, she reached the fourth round for the first time at this major defeating Peyton Stearns, 12th seed Veronika Kudermetova and 20th seed Donna Vekić. With this result, she has reached the fourth round at all major tournaments.</p>
        <p>In the fourth round, she defeated 32nd seed and fellow Czech Marie Bouzková, reaching the quarterfinals of a major for the first time since the 2019 French Open. In the quarterfinals, she overcame a 1–4 third-set deficit to beat fourth seed Jessica Pegula for her first Wimbledon semifinal. She became only the third woman in the Open Era to defeat four seeds to reach the semifinals at the All England Club along with Zheng Jie (2008) and Barbora Strýcová (2019). She defeated Elina Svitolina, who had received a wildcard into the tournament, in straight sets to progress to her first Wimbledon final and second Grand Slam final overall. On 15 July, she beat Ons Jabeur in the final, collapsing to the ground upon becoming the first unseeded ladies' singles Wimbledon champion in the Open Era. Her No.-42-world ranking made her the lowest ranked Wimbledon champion in the Open Era. Following reaching the quarterfinals at the US Open for the first time, she moved to a new career-high of world No. 6, on 11 September 2023.</p>
