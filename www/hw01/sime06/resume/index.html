                <h3>Basic information</h3>
                <p><strong>Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger</strong> (born July 30, 1947) is an Austrian and American actor,
                    businessman,
                    filmmaker, former politician, and former professional bodybuilder best known for his roles in
                    high-profile action movies. He served as the 38th governor of California from 2003 to 2011 and was
                    among Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world in 2004 and 2007.</p>

                <h3>Acting career</h3>
                <p>Schwarzenegger's breakthrough film was the sword and sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian in 1982, which
                    was a box-office hit. This was followed by a sequel, Conan the Destroyer, in 1984, although it
                    was not as successful as its predecessor. In 1983, Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional
                    video Carnival in Rio. In 1984, he made his first appearance as the eponymous character in James
                    Cameron's science fiction action film The Terminator. It has been called his acting
                    career's signature role. Following this, Schwarzenegger made another sword and sorcery film, Red
                    Sonja, in 1985. During the 1980s, audiences had an appetite for action films, with both
                    Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone becoming international stars. During the
                    Schwarzenegger-Stallone rivalry they attacked each other in the press, and tried to surpass the
                    other with more on-screen killings and larger weapons.</p>

                <h3>Bodybuilding career</h3>
                <p>Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding, and
                    his legacy is commemorated in the Arnold Classic annual bodybuilding competition. He has remained a
                    prominent face in bodybuilding long after his retirement, in part because of his ownership of gyms
                    and fitness magazines. He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows.</p>
                <p>Schwarzenegger continues to work out. When asked about his personal training during the 2011 Arnold
                    Classic he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day.</p>

                <h3>Political career</h3>
                <p>Schwarzenegger announced his candidacy in the 2003 California recall election for Governor of
                    California on the August 6, 2003, episode of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Schwarzenegger had
                    the most name recognition in a crowded field of candidates, but he had never held public office and
                    his political views were unknown to most Californians. His candidacy immediately became national and
                    international news, with media outlets dubbing him the "Governator" (referring to The Terminator
                    movies, see above) and "The Running Man" (the name of another one of his films), and calling the
                    recall election "Total Recall" (yet another movie starring Schwarzenegger). Schwarzenegger declined
                    to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates, and appeared in only one
                    debate on September 24, 2003.</p>
